Glazed:Good morning everyone! 
Glazed:Today you’ll begin outlining your research proposals for the studies you’ll conduct this semester. 
Glazed:Of course every pair’s proposal will be different, 
Glazed:but I’ll be here to help guide you through the process and answer any questions you might have, okay? 
Glazed:Any questions? No? 
Glazed:Then let’s begin. 
Glazed:Jelly Donut, could you help me hand out-
Glazed:Oh, this isn’t right. 
Glazed:I brought the wrong worksheets. 
Glazed:Okay then, Jelly Donut, could you and your partner go to the faculty office and get a stack of “Research Proposal” worksheets? 
Glazed:They should be in the supply closet next to my desk.
JD:I can get them myself.
Glazed:They might be buried in there. 
Glazed:It’d be faster to have two donuts look.
JD:*sigh* Sure.

JD:God, why is it so dark in here?
JD:I was at least expecting there to be a lamp.
JD:. . .
JD:Whatever. 
JD:I’m gonna look over here.
JD:You can do whatever you want, 
JD:I’m sure I’ll find it eventually.

JD:What?! 
JD:No. 
JD:Why would you ask me that?
JD:. . .
JD:Look, 
JD:I hardly know you. 
JD:And like I said, 
JD:I don’t care what you do, 
JD:so don’t take it personally.

JD:Are you trying to get to know me or something?
JD:No offense, but I don’t really have time for that.

JD:You know what, 
JD:could you help me lift this box? 
JD:The one under it says “Proposals”, 
JD:so that seems promising.
JD:I just wanna get out of here already.

JD:AH!!
JD:Don’t drop the box so suddenly! 
JD:What’s your problem?

Are you afraid of the dark?
Sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose.

JD:What?! 
JD:Don’t be ridiculous,

JD:I don’t have to defend myself,

J.D. walked back to class a few paces ahead of me.
