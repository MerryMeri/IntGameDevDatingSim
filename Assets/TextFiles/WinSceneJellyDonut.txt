[name]:What are we doing here again?
JD:Professor Glazed said we’re getting some kind of award for “distinguished achievement”. 
JD:I’m not really sure what that means, especially because our study wasn’t actually published anywhere. 
JD:But I figure we see whatever this is about and then go out for ice cream.
[name]:Ooh yay!
[name]:Sitting through boring ceremonies is a lot easier when you know there’ll be snacks after.
Glazed:Hey you two!
Glazed:Sorry to call you down here on a Saturday.
Glazed:I just wanted to let you know that I absolutely loved your research paper!
Glazed"Really great work!
JD:Oh wow, thank you professor.

Glazed:Well, either way.
Glazed:I was going to give you a little plastic trophy I got for the occasion, but I found it broken on the floor of the supply closet.
[name]:Oh...
JD:Oh yeah that’s rough.
Glazed:Well anyway, congrats!
Glazed:So, if you could do me a favor and clean out the supply closet before you leave, I'd really appreciate it! 
Glazed:Good luck!
Professor Glazed swiftly left the classroom.
[name]:Did they know we broke it?!
JD:It could be. 
JD:But I’m not going back in there.
[name]:What? 
[name]:We have to! 
[name]:We broke it.
JD:This one’s all you! 
JD:But I’ll cheer you on from outside the door.
[name]:No way. 
[name]:I'm getting a lamp because you’re gonna hold the dust pail.
J.D. and I bickered for a while while trying to clean up the supply closet.
We ended up breaking several other small objects by accident, decided to call it quits, and got some ice cream. 
THE END.
