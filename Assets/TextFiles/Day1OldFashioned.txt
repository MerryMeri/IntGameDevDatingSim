Uggh.
So many boxes.
Why did I bring so many boxes?
I should’ve asked someone for help.
Okay, a few more steps.
This is fine.
Oh god I’m dropping it.
No, I got this!
I can make it!
[name]:Oops.
playSoundThud
The box I was carrying slipped out of my grasp and began tumbling down the stairs behind me.
playSoundCrash
The box finally crashed into the door at the bottom of the stairs and I ran down after it.
Oh god that was so loud.
I hope no one was home.
As I clammered to collect the scattered contents of the box, the apartment door in front of me opened.
???:What is going on?!
???:I’m trying to work.
This is my nightmare.
[name]:Ah, hi!
[name]:I’m so sorry.
[name]:I was just trying to move in and the box just kind of slipped out of my hand.
???:Oh.
???:Well okay then.
[name]:Sorry to bother you.
[name]I’ll be more careful.
???:Do you have a lot left to carry?
[name]:Huh?
[name]:Oh, um, a bit.
???:I’ll help you.

That’s not necessary.
Wow, really?

[name]:I wouldn’t want you to interrupt your work anymore.
[name]:I can handle it.
???:It’s fine, I’m not on the clock or anything.
???:Besides, if you just keep dropping things outside the door I don’t know how much I’d be able to focus anyway.
???:This is less work for both of us.
[name]:Ah.
[name]:You know, I’m not incompetent.
[name]:It was really just an accident.
???:I don’t think that.
???:I just think you’re making extra work for yourself.
[name]:How so?

[name]:That’s so nice of you.
[name]:I was just thinking that I wished I had asked someone to help me.
[name]:But I know what a pain it is to move, and I didn’t want to subject any of my friends to that so-

The stranger went back into their apartment without saying anything and closed the door.
[name]:Um...
The stranger suddenly poked their head out of the door.
???:Wait here for a second.
The stranger went back into their apartment, and came out a second later holding a bunch of fabric belts.
[name]:What’re those?
???:Just watch.
The stranger took two of the belts, laid them on the floor and placed the box on top of them.
Then they grabbed the belts by the ends and lifted the box like it was nothing.
[name]:Oh, cool!
???:These are moving straps.
???:See?
???:Work smart, not hard.
[name]:Yeah okay...
[name]:Thanks for your help.
[name]:Um, sorry, what’s your name?
Oldie:Oh, I’m Old Fashioned Donut, but everyone just calls me Oldie.
[name]:Nice to meet you.
Oldie:Okay, let’s go get the rest of your boxes.
[name]:Right.
Oldie:Are you a student?
[name]:Ah, yeah!
[name]:How’d you know?
Oldie:Your shirt says “Fried Sweets University”.
[name]:Oh yeah, I forgot.
[name]:Are you a student too?
Oldie:Not anymore.
Oldie:But I went to the same school you’re going to.
[name]:Oh really?
[name]:I thought we might be around the same age.
Oldie:We probably are, I just graduated early.
[name]:Ah, cool.
[name]:So you work now?
Oldie:Yeah, I’m a freelance writer for magazines and things like that.
Oldie:I write novels too.

I said goodbye to Old Fashioned Donut, and went into my apartment to unpack.
