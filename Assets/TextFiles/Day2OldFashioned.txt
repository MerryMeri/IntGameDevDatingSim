[name]:Nooo.
[name]:Door, why won’t you open?
[name]:Please. . .
I slumped down against the outside of my apartment door.
There’s nothing I can do.
I can’t find my keys.
I’m so tired. . .
What should I do?
OLDIE:Whatcha doing?
[name]:Oh!
[name]:Hi.
[name]:Nothing much. . .
[name]:just hangin out.
OLDIE:?
[name]:I don’t have my key.
OLDIE:You forgot your keys?
OLDIE:Aren’t you an adult?
[name]:Hey!
[name]:Losing your key is like an adult’s best event.
[name]:Followed by drinking and being depressed.
OLDIE:And then the 100 meter backstroke,
OLDIE:because you have to retrace your steps to find it.
[name]:I see you’re not a comedy writer.
[name]:One mystery solved.
OLDIE:I’m not a mystery writer either.
[name]:Too bad.
[name]:Maybe you could’ve found my keys.
OLDIE:They’re probably in your apartment.
[name]:You’re not a detective, what do you know?
OLDIE:Come on.
[name]:Come where?
OLDIE:You can sit in my place until the super comes to let you in.
OLDIE:You called the super right?
[name]:Uh no, not yet.
[name]:Anyway, I can wait out here.
OLDIE:You’re just gonna sit out here?
OLDIE:I mean, it’s up to you.
OLDIE:But Crumb Cake Donut in 3C might ask you to read their radio play.
OLDIE:So, you’ve been warned.
[name]:More writers live here?
OLDIE:If you call that writing, sure.
[name]:You’re totally jealous.
[name]:Bet you wish you could write a radio play.
OLDIE:Yeah, I hope all those donuts in their cars will one day have the sounds of my mediocrity as a backdrop to their morning commute.
[name]:Now I’m even more convinced.
[name]:Someone in print media dunking on radio?
[name]:1900 wants it’s obsolete argument back.
OLDIE:The 80s called, they want their overused joke back.
[name]:We can’t give it back.
[name]:That would be a bootstrap paradox.
OLDIE:Okay just shut up then.
[name]:Late-night Oldie is sassy.
OLDIE:I’m not sassy, I’m just tired.
OLDIE:I stayed up working to meet my deadline.

[name]:I’ve pulled a couple of all-nighters in my day.
[name]:Pretty frequently at my old college actually.
[name]:I know it’s not easy.
[name]:One time I got so hopped up on caffeine my vision got blurry.
[name]:Not fun.
OLDIE:I’ve done college,
OLDIE:and it was nothing compared to this.
OLDIE:At least those classes were for my benefit mostly.
OLDIE:If I don’t finish my work on time now, I’m afraid my editor will murder me.
[name]:Really?
OLDIE:Not really, but kind of.

startBranch2
OLDIE:In what way?
OLDIE:Because it took me so long to do that I almost didn’t finish?
OLDIE:Or that I had to work under even more stressful conditions than usual?
[name]:Okay, no sorry.
[name]:I just meant it’s a tough thing to do, so good on you for getting through it.

[name]:You know, you’ve had a long day already.

OLDIE:I said it’s fine.
I waited as Old Fashioned Donut rifled through their bag for a key.

Old Fashioned Donut buried their face in their hands.
[name]:What’s up?
OLDIE:. . .
Old Fashioned Donut mumbling incomprehensibly.
OLDIE:idounabmakee.
Old Fashioned Donut was still hiding their face.
[name]:What?
OLDIE:I don’t have my key. . .

[name]:Well, I hope you don’t mind if I sleep at the top of the stairs.
[name]:It’s closer to my place.
[name]:You’re free to sleep at the bottom.
[name]:I’ll let you know now,
[name]:I do snore.
[name]:But, I promise that if I get up to pee in the middle of the night, I won’t wake you up. 
[name]:I’ll just step over you.
OLDIE:Oh really, you’d do that for me?
[name]:Yup!
OLDIE:So considerate.
[name]:I try.
OLDIE:Are you serious?
[name]:No, I’m just trying to lighten the mood.
OLDIE:. . .
[name]:I forgot mine too, it’s okay.

Old Fashioned Donut took our their phone and started dialing.
[name]:Who’re you calling?
OLDIE:The super.
Old Fashioned Donut and I sat on the stairs, waiting to be rescued by the super.
