I arrived at the library lobby and looked around for J.D.
. . .
I wonder why they’re not here?
They said to meet in the lobby at 12.
. . .Right?
Maybe I should look in the psychology section.
As I finished climbing the stairs to the second floor,
I spotted J.D. grabbing a book from a nearby shelf.
[name]:Hey!
JD:Oh,
JD:you’re here.
[name]:I thought we were meeting in the lobby?
JD:I waited there.
JD:I figured you weren’t gonna show.
[name]:How long did you wait?
JD:A minute.
[name]:That’s not waiting, that’s like you blinked three times and called it a day.
JD:More like 15 times.
[name]:Why did you think I wouldn’t show?
JD:How should I know?
JD:Your priorities are your own.
JD:Can’t expect everyone to care as much about the class as I do.
[name]:That's pretty self-righteous.
JD:I don’t mean to be.
JD:I’m just saying, it’s reasonable or even expected that donuts have better things to do on a Saturday than to come here.
[name]:But you don’t?
JD:Nope.
JD:You can go if you want.
[name]:So staying means I have no life, and leaving means I don’t care?!
JD:No!
JD:I mean,
JD:I didn’t mean that.
JD:I’m just being an idiot.
JD:. . .
JD:I’m sorry.
JD:Thank you for coming.

It’s fine.
You’re not an idiot.

JD:No, it’s not.
JD:I really meant it more about myself.
JD:I’m the one being weird,
JD:I shouldn’t criticize anyone else.
[name]:It’s okay to care about a class.
JD:It’s not that.

JD:. . .
[name]:I say stupid stuff all the time.
[name]:I appreciate that you apologized.

JD:I was trying to say that you don’t have to waste the day here with me, but I called you a jerk instead.
[name]:It’s really okay.
[name]:And there’s no need to assume the worst.
decisionBranch
I like you. 
You seem nice enough.

JD:. . .
JD:Really?
JD:Why?
[name]:Come on!
[name]:You have good ideas, and I can tell you’re passionate about what you do.

[name]:You should be more confident.
JD:We don’t have to talk about this anymore.
JD:Since you’re here we should get to work.
[name]:Alright, sounds good.
JD:And um. . .
JD:thank you.
I think I’m starting to understand J.D. a little bit better.
I finished up at the library and went home.
