Well I think that’s all the cleaning I had to do.
My homework’s done too.
I guess I can just chill out then.
*KNOCK*KNOCK* //(knocking sound effect)
Oh.
Someone’s at the door?
OLDIE:Are you doing anything right now?
[name]:Not really.
[name]:What’s up?
OLDIE:Can I ask you to help me out with something?
OLDIE:I was just working on my story for this week, and I could use a second opinion.
[name]:You want my help?
[name]:I don’t really have any experience writing.
OLDIE:It doesn’t matter.
OLDIE:I just want your opinion on some ideas for the plot.
[name]:Okay sure.
OLDIE:Okay.
Oldie looked at the legal pad they were holding, and turned to a page filled with scrawled writing.
OLDIE:So I’m going to give you one of my scenarios, 
OLDIE:and I want you to pick which way you think the story should go, okay?
OLDIE:Just pick whatever you think is the most interesting.
OLDIE:Okay,	
OLDIE:“You come to a door and try to open it.”
OLDIE:Now, what do you think is a more interesting development?

“The door’s actually a portal to another dimension.” -->
	
	OLD FASHIONED DONUT
	Okay.
	“In that dimension. . .”

	PLAYER
	“All matter is fruit. Earth is a giant Kiwi.” -->
		
		PLAYER
		Am I also fruit?
			
		OLD FASHIONED DONUT
		Are you?
			
		PLAYER
		“You instantly become fruit.” -->

			OLD FASHIONED DONUT
			“You’re fruit now.”
			“The end.”

			PLAYER
			Aw.

		“You run around fruit world.” -->
	
			OLD FASHIONED DONUT
			“Because the whole world is fruit,”
			“you feel overwhelmed deciding what to eat.”
			“You starve.”

			PLAYER
			I definitely didn’t expect that.

	“You have a pet dog.” -->

		PLAYER
		Did we really need to go to another dimension for that?

		OLD FASHIONED DONUT
		“Yes because your dog is. . .”

		PLAYER
		“Snoopy” -->

			PLAYER
			I want my dog to be more talented and popular than me.
			Okay wait, we really didn’t need another dimension for this.

		“Clifford the Big Red Dog.” -->

			PLAYER
			I want my dog to be the size of my house.
			And live next to me in an even bigger house.

“The door, and all the other furniture come to life and speak to you.” -->
		
	OLD FASHIONED DONUT
	“What do they say?”

	PLAYER
	“Oh my god, am I a talking door?” -->
				
		OLD FASHIONED DONUT	
		“The door has an existential crisis.”
		“What do you do?”

		PLAYER
		“Comfort them.” -->
						
			OLD FASHIONED DONUT
			“You form a beautiful friendship built on mutual respect and trust.”

			PLAYER
			Wow!

		“Walk away.” -->
						
			OLD FASHIONED DONUT
			“You pretend you never heard them,”
			“until you convinced yourself you hadn’t.”
			“They haunt your dreams.”

			PLAYER
			Oh no. . .

	“We’re aliens disguised as furniture.” -->
			
		OLD FASHIONED DONUT
		Okay
		“What’s your next move?”
	
			PLAYER
			Call NASA.” -->
				
				OLD FASHIONED DONUT
				“They ignore you.”
				“In fact you can’t be sure whether they’re ignoring you or if you dialed the wrong number.”
				“Your phone is broken.”

				PLAYER
				Wait, the aliens weren’t even in that part!

				OLD FASHIONED DONUT
				Not every idea is a winner.

		“You remember you’re playing a video game.” -->
				
				OLD FASHIONED DONUT
				“It’s a game about romancing sentient furniture.”
				But I guess they’re all secretly aliens?
					
				PLAYER
				What a twist.

OLDIE:Okay.
OLDIE:You’ve laid out the scenario.
OLDIE:You know who you are.
OLDIE:Now, how does that make you feel?
[name]:What? 
OLDIE:I’m trying to come up with some fresh ideas by getting into the head of a character.
OLDIE:So, can you tell me what you’re thinking?
[name]:What genre is this again?
OLDIE:For this magazine it’s romance.
OLDIE:But I’ve been getting kind of bored with it.
OLDIE:I thought I might be able to keep it fresh by adding some kind of twist.
[name]:Oh!
[name]:Well it was definitely unexpected.
[name]:But I’m not sure if it translates well to a romance story.
OLDIE:Well first just tell me your character’s thoughts.
OLDIE:What are you feeling right now?
Old Fashioned Donut flipped to a fresh notepad page and looked at me expectantly.

I feel confused.
I feel conflicted.

OLDIE:Okay.

OLDIE:Uh-huh?
[name]:The question.

OLDIE:Ooh, that’s good.
OLDIE:Go on.
[name]:Um,
[name]:I can’t decide. . .
OLDIE:Okay good good.
OLDIE:You can’t decide. . .?
[name]:What to have for lunch.
OLDIE:Are you serious right now?
[name]:I’m sorry.
[name]:Let me try again.
OLDIE:No, forget it.
OLDIE:I think I might be overthinking this.
[name]:Why don’t you just pull from your own experiences?
OLDIE:There’s nothing there.
OLDIE:I’m married to my work.
[name]:But if you’ve written other romance stories, you must be getting those ideas from somewhere.
OLDIE:I really just make everything up.
OLDIE:But I don’t want my stories to feel hollow.
OLDIE:That's why I thought maybe I should get another perspective.
OLDIE:What do you think I should write about?
decisionBranch
You should write about everyday life.
You should write about a fantastical journey. 
endDecision
startBranch1
[name]:I think the drama of everyday life is really exciting to watch.
[name]:It can be funny and relatable but also really touching.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:It could be really interesting to make something super original and out there!
[name]:You could create your own world and lore, and explore life’s big questions.

OLDIE:Hm.
OLDIE:I could try that.
OLDIE:Thanks for helping me sort this stuff out.
OLDIE:You have pretty good ideas.
[name]:No problem!
[name]:It was fun.
OLDIE:I should get back to writing.
OLDIE:I’ll see you around.
[name]:Later.
Old Fashioned Donut went back to their apartment.
