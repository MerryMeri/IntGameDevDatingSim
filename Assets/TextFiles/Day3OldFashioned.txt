Well I think that’s all the cleaning I had to do.
My homework’s done too.
I guess I can just chill out then.
*KNOCK*KNOCK* //(knocking sound effect)
Oh.
Someone’s at the door?
Oldie:Are you doing anything right now?
[name]:Not really.
[name]:What’s up?
Oldie:Can I ask you to help me out with something?
Oldie:I was just working on my story for this week, and I could use a second opinion.
[name]:You want my help?
[name]:I don’t really have any experience writing.
Oldie:It doesn’t matter.
Oldie:I just want your opinion on some ideas for the plot.
[name]:Okay sure.
Oldie:Okay.
Oldie looked at the legal pad they were holding, and turned to a page filled with scrawled writing.
Oldie:So I’m going to give you one of my scenarios, 
Oldie:and I want you to pick which way you think the story should go, okay?
Oldie:Just pick whatever you think is the most interesting.
Oldie:Okay,	
Oldie:“You come to a door and try to open it.”
Oldie:Now, what do you think is a more interesting development?
decisionBranch
“The door’s actually a portal to another dimension.”
“The door, and all the other furniture come to life and speak to you.”
endDecision
startBranch1
Oldie:Okay.
Oldie:“In that dimension. . .”
decisionBranch
“All matter is fruit. Earth is a giant Kiwi.”
“You have a pet dog.”	
endDecision
startBranch1.1	
[name]:Am I also fruit?
Oldie:Are you?
decisionBranch
“You instantly become fruit.”
“You run around fruit world.”
endDecision
startBranch1.1.1
Oldie:“You’re fruit now.”
Oldie:“The end.”
[name]:Aw.
backToMain
startBranch1.1.2
Oldie:“Because the whole world is fruit, you feel overwhelmed deciding what to eat.”
Oldie:“You starve.”
[name]:I definitely didn’t expect that.
backToMain
startBranch1.2
[name]:Did we really need to go to another dimension for that?
Oldie:“Yes because your dog is. . .”
decisionBranch
“Snoopy”
“Clifford the Big Red Dog.”
endDecision
startBranch1.2.1
[name]:I want my dog to be more talented and popular than me.
[name]:Okay wait, we really didn’t need another dimension for this.
backToMain
startBranch1.2.2
[name]:I want my dog to be the size of my house.
[name]:And live next to me in an even bigger house.

startBranch2
Oldie:“What do they say?”
decisionBranch
“Oh my god, am I a talking door?”
“We’re aliens disguised as furniture.”
endDecision
startBranch2.1
Oldie:“The door has an existential crisis.”
Oldie:“What do you do?”
decisionBranch
“Comfort them.”
“Walk away.”
endDecision
startBranch2.1.1		
Oldie:“You form a beautiful friendship built on mutual respect and trust.”
[name]:Wow!
backToMain
startBranch2.1.2
Oldie:“You pretend you never heard them, until you convinced yourself you hadn’t.”
Oldie:“They haunt your dreams.”
[name]:Oh no. . .
backToMain
startBranch2.2
Oldie:Okay
Oldie:“What’s your next move?”
decisionBranch
“Call NASA.”
“You remember you’re playing a video game.”	
endDecision
startBranch2.2.1
Oldie:“They ignore you.”
Oldie:“In fact you can’t be sure whether they’re ignoring you or if you dialed the wrong number.”
Oldie:“Your phone is broken.”
[name]:Wait, the aliens weren’t even in that part!
Oldie:Not every idea is a winner.
backToMain
startBranch2.2.2	
Oldie:“It’s a game about romancing sentient furniture.”
Oldie:But I guess they’re all secretly aliens?
[name]:What a twist.
backToMain
mainContinue
Oldie:Okay.
Oldie:You’ve laid out the scenario.
Oldie:You know who you are.
Oldie:Now, how does that make you feel?
[name]:What? 
Oldie:I’m trying to come up with some fresh ideas by getting into the head of a character.
Oldie:So, can you tell me what you’re thinking?
[name]:What genre is this again?
Oldie:For this magazine it’s romance.
Oldie:But I’ve been getting kind of bored with it.
Oldie:I thought I might be able to keep it fresh by adding some kind of twist.
[name]:Oh!
[name]:Well it was definitely unexpected.
[name]:But I’m not sure if it translates well to a romance story.
Oldie:Well first just tell me your character’s thoughts.
Oldie:What are you feeling right now?
Old Fashioned Donut flipped to a fresh notepad page and looked at me expectantly.
decisionBranch
I feel confused.
I feel conflicted.
endDecision
startBranch1
Oldie:Okay.
[name]:Because I don’t understand. . .
Oldie:Uh-huh?
[name]:The question.
backToMain
startBranch2
Oldie:Ooh, that’s good.
Oldie:Go on.
[name]:Um,
[name]:I can’t decide. . .
Oldie:Okay good good.
Oldie:You can’t decide. . .?
[name]:What to have for lunch.
Oldie:Are you serious right now?
[name]:I’m sorry.
[name]:Let me try again.
Oldie:No, forget it.
Oldie:I think I might be overthinking this.
[name]:Why don’t you just pull from your own experiences?
Oldie:There’s nothing there.
Oldie:I’m married to my work.
[name]:But if you’ve written other romance stories, you must be getting those ideas from somewhere.
Oldie:I really just make everything up.
Oldie:But I don’t want my stories to feel hollow.
Oldie:That's why I thought maybe I should get another perspective.
Oldie:What do you think I should write about?
decisionBranch
You should write about everyday life.
You should write about a fantastical journey. 
endDecision
startBranch1
[name]:I think the drama of everyday life is really exciting to watch.
[name]:It can be funny and relatable but also really touching.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:It could be really interesting to make something super original and out there!
[name]:You could create your own world and lore, and explore life’s big questions.
backToMain

Oldie:Hm.
Oldie:I could try that.
Oldie:Thanks for helping me sort this stuff out.
Oldie:You have pretty good ideas.
[name]:No problem!
[name]:It was fun.
Oldie:I should get back to writing.
Oldie:I’ll see you around.
[name]:Later.
Old Fashioned Donut went back to their apartment.
