It’s the last day to work on our study discussion before it’s due.
I don’t know if J.D. is going to come.
We were getting along so well, I hope what happened didn’t scare them off.
JD:Hey.
[name]:Hey.
JD:How’s it going?
[name]:Fine, fine! 
[name]:I haven’t really written much yet, but I’m glad you’re here.
JD:I wouldn’t leave you to do it yourself.
JD:. . .
JD:I’m sorry the interview was such a disaster.
JD:I’m honestly mortified.
[name]:It was a stressful situation.

Anyone would’ve had a hard time dealing with it.
I don’t think any less of you.

JD:Do you remember when we were trying to design our survey, and you asked me a question I refused to answer?
[name]:Hm, I’m not sure.
JD:You asked, 
JDQuestion
[name]:Oh yeah.
JD:I've been thinking about it a lot since then, and I think I finally have an answer.

JD:What I really care about more than anything is making connections with other donuts.
JD:I guess that’s what a lot of donuts want.
JD:But as much as I want that, I make it impossible for myself.
JD:Whether I’m being abrasive or just refusing to talk at all,
JD:I constantly prevent donuts from getting to know me because I'm afraid they won’t like me.

JD:As tempting as it is to give the easy answer like “the dark”, or “heights”, or “Chuck E. Cheese”, that’s not honest.
JD:I’m really just terrified of rejection.
JD:Maybe it’s really obvious, I don’t know.
JD:But it makes me lash out and push other donuts away before they get the chance to shut me down.

JD:I regret a lot of things about my life.
JD:But the thing that haunts me the most is never opening up to other donuts.
JD:I can think of a million times i wanted to say something, or reach out to someone, 
JD:but I stop myself because I think no one will want to hear it.

JD:You’re probably wondering why I’m telling you this.
JD:The truth is, you remind me of my ex.
JD:Your optimism, your openness, it’s everything I’m not.
JD:. . .
JD:But I want to be better.
JD:I don’t want to live my life making myself miserable and angry because I’m too afraid to be vulnerable.
JD:I guess what I’m trying to say is, thank you.
[name]:For what?
JD:For being so nice to me.
JD:Getting to know you let me see what’s it’s like to feel support and belonging, and everything else I was missing out on.

I’m really happy for you.
It was nothing.

[name]:You’re my friend, and I’m really glad I met you.
J.D. gave me a warm smile.
JD:Now let’s write a boring research paper!
[name]:Yeah!
J.D. and I spent the rest of the day hanging out at the library.
