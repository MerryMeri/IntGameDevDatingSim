[name]:So, it’ll be $80.73.
CUSTOMER:Sure. 
CUSTOMER:Here you go.
The customer pulled a card out of their wallet and handed it to me.
I swiped the card through the reader and finished the transaction.
[name]:Okay, here’s your receipt.
[name]:Have a nice day!
CUSTOMER:Wait, you swiped it already?
[name]:Yeah.
CUSTOMER:I needed you to split it between two cards.
[name]:But the transaction went through okay.
CUSTOMER:But my accounts gonna be overdrawn now, 
CUSTOMER:I didn’t have enough in there!
[name]:I’m sorry.
CUSTOMER:I wish you would’ve waited.

But you didn’t say you were paying with two cards. 
I didn’t mean to.

CUSTOMER:Now what the hell am I supposed to do?
[name]:I can try to cancel it.
CUSTOMER:You’ve screwed up enough.
CUSTOMER:Where’s your manager?
[name]:Um. . .
BERRY:Hey, what’s going on?
BERRY:Can I help you?
CUSTOMER:Your employee messed up my payment and you need to fix it.
BERRY:I’m sure it was just a misunderstanding.
BERRY:I’ll see what I can do.
CUSTOMER:If I don’t get that money back in my account, I’m never coming here again.
CUSTOMER:Do you understand?
BERRY:How did you want to pay?
CUSTOMER:I wanted to split it between two cards.
BERRY:Okay.
BERRY:I just credited half the price of your bill onto your card.
BERRY:May I use the other card?
CUSTOMER:You put my money back on there?
BERRY:$40.36, back on the card.
CUSTOMER:Fine, good.
CUSTOMER:Here.
The customer passed another card to Strawberry Sprinkled Donut,
who completed the transaction and then passed back the card with a new receipt.
CUSTOMER:Finally.
CUSTOMER:Your clerk is useless by the way.
BERRY:There’s no need for that.
CUSTOMER:There was no need for it to get screwed up in the first pla-
BERRY:Have a nice rest of your day.
The customer stopped short, exhaled, then left the store.
[name]:I’m so sorry.
BERRY:What? 
BERRY:Don’t be, you didn’t do anything wrong.
[name]:But I ruined that whole thing, 
[name]:and probably lost a customer.
BERRY:We don’t need them back.
BERRY:And it was an honest mistake.
[name]:I shouldn’t have contradicted them, 
[name]:I feel like that made it worse.
BERRY:No, it’s not you.
BERRY:When Donuts act like that, they aren’t really interested in listening.
BERRY:They really just care about getting their point across.
BERRY:I find it's best to treat them like a child having a tantrum.
BERRY:They can scream themselves out, 
BERRY:but in the end they’re just shouting their anger into the void.
BERRY:But you didn’t do anything wrong, so don’t worry about it.

BERRY:Now come on, let’s get back to work.
BERRY:That must’ve been stressful, so I’ll take over the register for a while.
BERRY:You can organize stuff in the back to take it easy for a bit, okay?
I finished my shift at the diner and went home.
