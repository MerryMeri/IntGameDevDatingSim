[name]:Did you enjoy your meal?
Customer:It was great, thanks.
[name]:Great. 
[name]:So, it’ll be $80.73.
Customer:Sure. 
Customer:Here you go.
The Customer pulled a card out of their wallet and handed it to me.
I swiped the card through the reader and finished the transaction.
[name]:Okay, here’s your receipt.
[name]:Have a nice day!
Customer:Wait, you swiped it already?
[name]:Yeah.
Customer:I needed you to split it between two cards.
[name]:But the transaction went through okay.
Customer:But my accounts gonna be overdrawn now, 
Customer:I didn’t have enough in there!
[name]:I’m sorry.
Customer:I wish you would’ve waited.

But you didn’t say you were paying with two cards. 
I didn’t mean to.

Customer:Now what the hell am I supposed to do?
[name]:I can try to cancel it.
Customer:You’ve screwed up enough.
Customer:Where’s your manager?
[name]:Um. . .
Berry:Hey, what’s going on?
Berry:Can I help you?
Customer:Your employee messed up my payment and you need to fix it.
Berry:I’m sure it was just a misunderstanding.
Berry:I’ll see what I can do.
Customer:If I don’t get that money back in my account, I’m never coming here again.
Customer:Do you understand?
Berry:How did you want to pay?
Customer:I wanted to split it between two cards.
Berry:Okay.
Berry:I just credited half the price of your bill onto your card.
Berry:May I use the other card?
Customer:You put my money back on there?
Berry:$40.36, back on the card.
Customer:Fine, good.
Customer:Here.
The Customer passed another card to StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut,
who completed the transaction and then passed back the card with a new receipt.
Customer:Finally.
Customer:Your clerk is useless by the way.
Berry:There’s no need for that.
Customer:There was no need for it to get screwed up in the first pla-
Berry:Have a nice rest of your day.
The Customer stopped short, exhaled, then left the store.
[name]:I’m so sorry.
Berry:What? 
Berry:Don’t be, you didn’t do anything wrong.
[name]:But I ruined that whole thing, 
[name]:and probably lost a Customer.
Berry:We don’t need them back.
Berry:And it was an honest mistake.
[name]:I shouldn’t have contradicted them, 
[name]:I feel like that made it worse.
Berry:No, it’s not you.
Berry:When Donuts act like that, they aren’t really interested in listening.
Berry:They really just care about getting their point across.
Berry:I find it's best to treat them like a child having a tantrum.
Berry:They can scream themselves out, 
Berry:but in the end they’re just shouting their anger into the void.
Berry:But you didn’t do anything wrong, so don’t worry about it.

Berry:Now come on, let’s get back to work.
Berry:That must’ve been stressful, so I’ll take over the register for a while.
Berry:You can organize stuff in the back to take it easy for a bit, okay?
I finished my shift at the diner and went home.
