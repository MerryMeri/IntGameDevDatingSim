BERRY:You did a great job on the pastry display.
[name]:Oh thanks!
BERRY:I’ll lock up, you can head out!
[name]:Are you sure?
BERRY:Yeah, I’ve gotta wait for the bus anyway.
[name]:Don’t you usually drive?
BERRY:I take the bus on Sundays because my dad needs the car.

Your dad doesn’t have his own car? 
That’s nice of you.

It’s nice to have company. -->
	
	STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
	I know what you mean.
	I like to listen to music when I commute usually,
	but it’s nice to have someone to talk to.
	And we can practice our commuter small talk!
	“This weather, huh?”

		PLAYER
		It’s beautiful out. -->

			STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
			I know right?
			It’s nice when the night is kind of still and dewy.
			It reminds me of summer.

		I like the rain better. -->
			
			STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
			I like rain too!
			It’s nice to have an excuse to just stay inside and be comfy.
			Plus it makes for a kind of cozy atmosphere I think.
	
We should get to know each other better. -->

	STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
	Yeah!
	As long as we don’t talk about work.
	If I have to look at another empty ketchup bottle,
	I’ll be seeing red.
	Seeing red!
	Get it?

	PLAYER
	You’re a comedic genius. -->

		STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
		Don’t sass me Player Name.
		You’re talking to the donut that signs the checks.

	Laugh Genuinely. -->

		STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
		“Laugh Genuinely”?
		Why would I laugh at my own joke?
		Or did you just say what you were thinking?
		Either way, not exactly the response I was hoping for,
		but that’s fine!

BERRY:So how are you liking school?
decisionBranch
It’s been good!
It’s a little stressful.

[name]:the students and professors are really nice,

BERRY:Yeah, it can be like that.
BERRY:Especially since you’re a transfer student.
BERRY:It must be difficult to complete degree requirements when you’re already halfway through.
BERRY:And then there’s the headache of which of your old school’s credits the new school will even take.
BERRY:I don’t envy you.

BERRY:You know,
BERRY:I think it's really great that you decided to change schools.
BERRY:I’ve known donuts that even though they were unhappy with their job or school,
BERRY:the thought of changing it was so overwhelming that they ended up staying stuck.
BERRY:Not to say that I think change is easy or anything, 
BERRY:it's obviously not.
BERRY:But I think it’s inspiring to see someone follow their heart.
