Berry:Hey good work today, [name]!
Berry:You did a great job on the pastry display.
[name]:Oh thanks!
Berry:I’ll lock up, you can head out!
[name]:Are you sure?
Berry:Yeah, I’ve gotta wait for the bus anyway.
[name]:Don’t you usually drive?
Berry:I take the bus on Sundays because my dad needs the car.
decisionBranch
Your dad doesn’t have his own car? 
That’s nice of you. 
endDecision
startBranch1
Berry:No.
Berry:He’s a bit older and doesn’t need to use it as much,
Berry:so we share one.

startBranch2
Berry:It’s just what I gotta do.
Berry:It doesn’t make sense to pay for two cars when we can get by with one.

[name]:Oh okay.
[name]:I actually take the bus too.
Berry:Oh!
Berry:I didn’t know.
Berry:This should be fun then!
Berry:Oh, here it is. //(bus exhaust sound effect)
decisionBranch
It’s nice to have company.
We should get to know each other better.
endDecision
startBranch1
Berry:I know what you mean.
Berry:I like to listen to music when I commute usually, but it’s nice to have someone to talk to.
Berry:And we can practice our commuter small talk!
Berry:“This weather, huh?”
decisionBranch
It’s beautiful out.
I like the rain better.
endDecision
startBranch1.1
Berry:I know right?
Berry:It’s nice when the night is kind of still and dewy.
Berry:It reminds me of summer.
backToMain
startBranch1.2
Berry:I like rain too!
Berry:It’s nice to have an excuse to just stay inside and be comfy.
Berry:Plus it makes for a kind of cozy atmosphere I think.
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:Yeah!
Berry:As long as we don’t talk about work.
Berry:If I have to look at another empty ketchup bottle, I’ll be seeing red.
Berry:Seeing red!
Berry:Get it?
decisionBranch
You’re a comedic genius.
Laugh Genuinely.
endDecision
startBranch2.1
Berry:Don’t sass me [name].
Berry:You’re talking to the donut that signs the checks.

startBranch2.2
Berry:“Laugh Genuinely”?
Berry:Why would I laugh at my own joke?
Berry:Or did you just say what you were thinking?
Berry:Either way, not exactly the response I was hoping for, but that’s fine!
Berry:So how are you liking school?
decisionBranch
It’s been good!
It’s a little stressful.
endDecision
startBranch1
[name]:I like my classes,
[name]:the students and professors are really nice,
[name]:and I’m learning a lot I think.
[name]:I definitely like it better than my old school.
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:Yeah, it can be like that.
Berry:Especially since you’re a transfer student.
Berry:It must be difficult to complete degree requirements when you’re already halfway through.
Berry:And then there’s the headache of which of your old school’s credits the new school will even take.
Berry:I don’t envy you.

Berry:You know,
Berry:I think it's really great that you decided to change schools.
Berry:I’ve known donuts that even though they were unhappy with their job or school,
Berry:the thought of changing it was so overwhelming that they ended up staying stuck.
Berry:Not to say that I think change is easy or anything, 
Berry:it's obviously not.
Berry:But I think it’s inspiring to see someone follow their heart.
decisionBranch
Thank you.
It’s no big deal.
endDecision
startBranch1
Berry:Of course!
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:If you say so. 
I think it’s pretty impressive.
backToMain
Berry:So what made you decide to come here?
decisionBranch
The academics.
The student life.
endDecision	
startBranch1
Berry:Ah right, of course.
Berry:That’s what drew me to the graduate program.
Berry:It’s challenging, 
Berry:but I think that’s what I needed.
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:Have you been to the student center yet?
Berry:They’re always holding concerts there.
Berry:It’s usually small student groups,
Berry:but they’re pretty good!

Berry:Oh! This is my stop.
Berry:It was great talking to you!
