Okay, that’s the last table I needed to clear.
But it’s getting kind of busy in here.
Where’s StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut?
Maybe I should check in the back.

I saw the storeroom’s slightly open door and called out.
[name]:Hey StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut?
[name]:Things are getting kind of-
Berry:Because I don’t have time for this!
Berry:If you called me just to yell, I’m hanging up.
Oh no.
What’s going on?
Berry:I don’t know what you expect me to do.
Berry:If she refuses to do it, then nothing I say is gonna mean anything.
This sounds really private, I should leave.
I turned quickly to leave, but-
*CRASH*
In my haste, I knocked a plate off the counter and it shattered onto the floor.
Oh crap!
I can’t leave this here like this.
Gotta clean it up quick!
Berry:So you just want her to get pissed at me so you don’t have to deal with it?
Berry:Because how is that my responsibility?
Berry:. . .
Berry:You know what? 
Berry:It’s not even worth it.
Berry:I’ll just do it, okay?
Berry:Will that make this stop?
Berry:. . .
Berry:Because I’m exhausted!
Berry:If we’re at the point that it’s more tiring to argue over who does the chores than it is to actually do them, then I’ll just do it!
Berry:. . .
Berry:I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
Berry:I have to go.
Berry:. . .
Berry:Sure, love you, bye.
Oh no, they’re coming!
Maybe I should pretend I didn’t hear.
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut came out from the storeroom looking shaken and annoyed.
Berry:Oh!
Berry:Hi [name].
Berry:How’s everything going out there?
[name]:Everythings fine!
[name]:It’s just getting a little busy, so I came to get you.
Berry:Oh. . .
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut looked at me critically,
as if trying to assess whether I’d heard anything just from my expression.
I should probably say something.

I accidentally broke a plate. 
Are you okay?

Berry:No offense, but I can tell that you’re deflecting.
[name]:What?
Berry:You don’t have to pretend, it’s fine.

Berry:You’re not even gonna pretend you didn’t hear?

[name]:I am so sorry.
[name]:I really didn’t mean to hear, but I dropped a plate on the floor and I thought it would be worse if I just left it lying there.
Berry:I believe you.
Berry:It’s just petty, family stuff.
Berry:I’m sorry you had to hear any of it.
Berry:I tell them not to call me at work but. . .

We don’t have to talk about it.
It must be hard.

startBranch1
Berry:It’s okay.
Berry:I’m not embarrassed.
Berry:Everyone has their own problems, right?

startBranch2
Berry:It’s just my lot, you know?
Berry:I do what I have to to make the best of things.
Berry:And it’s really not as bad as it might’ve sounded.

Berry:I’m really okay with how things are.
Berry:It’s better for me to be working hard and a little tired, because then I at least feel like I’m doing something.

I see what you mean. 
I don’t understand.

startBranch1
Berry:Really?
Berry:That’s kind of nice to hear.
Berry:I don’t get to talk about it too often.

Berry:It’s like,
Berry:I have all this responsibility that I never really asked for, but at least I have some control over the future.

Berry:It is what it is, so I just keep moving forward.
[name]:And you’re okay with that?
Berry:Well I guess sometimes I can feel a little stuck.
Berry:Like, I don’t want my relationship with my family to define my entire life.
Berry:I want “fulfillment” and “balance” just like everybody else so, for now I just do what I have to and hope I’ll get there someday.
Berry:Anyway, thanks for listening.
Berry:You’re a really nice donut.
Customer:Excuse me? 
Customer:Is anybody working here?
Berry:. . .
[name]:Uh-
Berry:Wait.
[name]:What?
Berry:Sorry, we’re just about to close!
Customer:Really? It’s the middle of the day.
[name]:I thought we were supposed to be open for another 3 hours?
Then StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut said something only I could hear.
Berry:I’m calling a holiday.
[name]:Can you do that?
Berry:I’m the manager!
Berry:What, am I gonna fire myself?
Customer:Hello?
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut strode toward the entrance to the dining area and went through the door.

Looking over the crowd of new customers, they stood up on a chair behind the counter.
Berry:Excuse me!
Berry:So sorry about the inconvenience everyone. 
Berry:It’s Fried Day, so we’ll be closing early.
The crowd groaned with hungry angst and general confusion.
Berry:So sorry everyone!
Berry:Thank you for your understanding.
As the last of the bewildered customers filed out, I turned to StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut.
[name]:What was that about?
Berry:I don’t know.
Berry:I guess I felt like doing something impulsive.

That was kinda crazy. 
That was awesome.

Berry:So, I’ll finish cleaning up here and you can head home.
Berry:I’ll make sure you get paid for the full shift.
Berry:Happy Fried Day!
[name]:No, I’ll stay and help!
[name]:I’m getting paid anyway.
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut smiled.
Berry:You’re a good donut.
Berry:Alright then!
Berry:I’ll order us some food as thanks.
[name]:I’ll start mopping!
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut and I spent the night cleaning and eating takeout.
