Berry:Oh good you’re here!
Berry:Can you pass me the tape?
Berry:It’s behind the counter.
[name]:Sure.
[name]:What’re all the decorations for?
Berry:Some company reserved half the restaurant for a retirement party, and they’re paying us to make it look a bit fancy.
[name]:Not that this place isn’t nice,
[name]:but if they were going for fancy, I don’t know if a diner was the right move.
Berry:I guess they're trying to get their old employees out the door with as little pomp as possible. 
Berry:It’s kind of sad, so I’m trying to make it look extra special with what we have.

It looks nice. 
Can I help?

Berry: [name], would you say you have a flair for design?

No, I’m pretty unoriginal. 
Um, I can try? 
I’m a decorating expert.

[name]:I helped my mom paint the outside of our house once.
[name]:But it was just white.
[name]:And repainting the restaurant probably isn’t practical,

[name]:Oh, maybe I could do that thing where you staple pieces of construction paper together to make a chain?
[name]:Or is that too reminiscent of elementary school?

[name]:Every party I had back in high school had special themes coordinated with all the snacks and cutlery. 
[name]:And I’m a wiz with streamers.
Berry:All right then expert, I give you creative license.

Berry:Why don’t you start by picking the placemats?
Berry:We have three different ones.
Berry:Red checkerboard with an old-fashioned looking version of the logo,
Berry:blue with a twinkly star pattern,
Berry:or yellow with a word search and crayons.
Berry:That last one is meant for kids, 
Berry:but crayons are fun for all ages so, what do you think?
[name]:Well. . .
decisionBranch
What’s your favorite color?
Which pattern do you like best?
Okay I’ll pick.
endDecision
startBranch1
Berry:Hm, it’s tough to pick just one.
Berry:I guess I’m partial to cool colors.
Berry:While I do like the coziness of warm colors, something about the mystery and drama of cool colors is really alluring.

Berry:I like the star pattern because it reminds me of “The Starry Night”.
Berry:The dark blue and soft yellow make it feel like you’re gazing into something really deep.

Berry:You can’t go wrong with a classic looking logo.
Berry:And I think the checkerboard goes well with the color of the restaurant.

Berry:That’s the one I would’ve picked!
Berry:I think the yellow and blue complement each other really well, and they liven up the plain color of the table.

Berry:It’s fun to have adults use kids' placemats.
Berry:And all the crayons will probably be a good conversation starter.

[name]:You seem to know a lot about art.
Berry:I actually used to do a lot of painting back in the day.
Berry:My undergrad degree was in visual art.
[name]:Wow, really?
[name]:So you’re an artist!
Berry:Not really anymore.
Berry:I don’t have much time for it now that I’m working and in school.
[name]:Do you miss it?
Berry:Of course!
Berry:My favorite part of it was probably the feeling of working on a project. 
Berry:I could concentrate so hard on it that everything else kind of blurred into the background. 
Berry:Sure it could get kind of tiring, 
Berry:but when it’s just you and the work, and you’re making something really beautiful, 
Berry:all the effort and problem solving that goes into it is really rewarding.
[name]:So why aren’t you studying art now?
Berry:Well originally I wanted to, 
Berry:but with the way my parents are. . .
Berry:it didn’t really seem practical.
[name]:Your parents?
Berry:They’re just getting older and can’t work as much anymore, 
Berry:and my younger siblings are still in school, 
Berry:so it’s too much financial stress to go into a field with such job insecurity.
Berry:And you know, 
Berry:as an elementary school teacher I can probably still bring my interest in art into my lessons and stuff. 
Berry:Most school projects before middle school are more about tri-fold boards, glue sticks and glitter than actual content anyway.

That’s very selfless.
You shouldn’t give up on your dream.
