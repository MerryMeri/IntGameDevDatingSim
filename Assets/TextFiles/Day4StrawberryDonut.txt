BERRY:Oh good you’re here!
BERRY:Can you pass me the tape?
BERRY:It’s behind the counter.
[name]:Sure.
[name]:What’re all the decorations for?
BERRY:Some company reserved half the restaurant for a retirement party, and they’re paying us to make it look a bit fancy.
[name]:Not that this place isn’t nice,
[name]:but if they were going for fancy, I don’t know if a diner was the right move.
BERRY:I guess they're trying to get their old employees out the door with as little pomp as possible. 
BERRY:It’s kind of sad, so I’m trying to make it look extra special with what we have.

It looks nice. 
Can I help?

No, I’m pretty unoriginal. 
Um, I can try? 
I’m a decorating expert.

[name]:I helped my mom paint the outside of our house once.
[name]:But it was just white.

[name]:Oh, maybe I could do that thing where you staple pieces of construction paper together to make a chain?
[name]:Or is that too reminiscent of elementary school?

[name]:Every party I had back in high school had special themes coordinated with all the snacks and cutlery. 
[name]:And I’m a wiz with streamers.
BERRY:All right then expert, I give you creative license.

BERRY:Why don’t you start by picking the placemats?
BERRY:We have three different ones.
BERRY:Red checkerboard with an old-fashioned looking version of the logo,
BERRY:blue with a twinkly star pattern,
BERRY:or yellow with a word search and crayons.
BERRY:That last one is meant for kids, 
BERRY:but crayons are fun for all ages so, what do you think?
[name]:Well. . .

What’s your favorite color? -->
	
	STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
	Hm, it’s tough to pick just one.
	I guess I’m partial to cool colors.
	While I do like the coziness of warm colors,
	something about the mystery and drama of cool colors is really alluring.

Which pattern do you like best? -->
	
	STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
	I like the star pattern because it reminds me of “The Starry Night”.
	The dark blue and soft yellow make it feel like you’re gazing into something really deep.

Okay I’ll pick. -->

	PLAYER
	The red. -->

		STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
		You can’t go wrong with a classic looking logo.
		And I think the checkerboard goes well with the color of the restaurant.
	
	The blue. -->
	
		STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
		That’s the one I would’ve picked!
		I think the yellow and blue complement each other really well,
		and they liven up the plain color of the table.

	The yellow. -->

		STRAWBERRY SPRINKLED DONUT
		It’s fun to have adults use kids' placemats.
		And all the crayons will probably be a good conversation starter.
		Art’s good for that kind of thing!

[name]:You seem to know a lot about art.
BERRY:I actually used to do a lot of painting back in the day.
BERRY:My undergrad degree was in visual art.
[name]:Wow, really?
[name]:So you’re an artist!
BERRY:Not really anymore.
BERRY:I don’t have much time for it now that I’m working and in school.
[name]:Do you miss it?
BERRY:Of course!
BERRY:My favorite part of it was probably the feeling of working on a project. 
BERRY:I could concentrate so hard on it that everything else kind of blurred into the background. 
BERRY:Sure it could get kind of tiring, 
BERRY:but when it’s just you and the work, and you’re making something really beautiful, 
BERRY:all the effort and problem solving that goes into it is really rewarding.
[name]:So why aren’t you studying art now?
BERRY:Well originally I wanted to, 
BERRY:but with the way my parents are. . .
BERRY:it didn’t really seem practical.
[name]:Your parents?
BERRY:They’re just getting older and can’t work as much anymore, 
BERRY:and my younger siblings are still in school, 
BERRY:so it’s too much financial stress to go into a field with such job insecurity.
BERRY:And you know, 
BERRY:as an elementary school teacher I can probably still bring my interest in art into my lessons and stuff. 
BERRY:Most school projects before middle school are more about tri-fold boards, glue sticks and glitter than actual content anyway.

That’s very selfless.
You shouldn’t give up on your dream.
