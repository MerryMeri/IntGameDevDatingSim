Glazed:Alright everyone, quiet please!
Glazed:I want you all to work on designing interview questions for the research topics you’ve chosen.
[name]:Research topic? 
[name]:I completely forgot what we chose!
JD:What are you talking about?
JD:You picked it.
JD:You seemed pretty jazzed about it too.
[name]:Oh. . .
[name]:right.
[name]:I think it was something to do with. . .

JD:Interesting that you didn't remember it.
JD:Maybe I should write that down.
decisionBranch
No, don’t!
Yes, I’m the perfect case study.

JD:I was joking.

JD:Heh.
JD:Probably best if we don’t conduct research on ourselves, but that’s a good plan b.

startBranch2
JD:Yeah that’s it. 
JD:I guess it’s not a terrible idea.
JD:But what’s our angle?
decisionBranch
The positive impact of relationships on the individual.
The negative impact of relationships on the individual.
endDecision
startBranch2.1
JD:Okay, but there must be a million other studies like that.
JD:I don’t really know what more we could have to say about it.

startBranch2.2
JD:That’s a bit of a hot take, but I appreciate that it’s different.

startBranch3
JD:Ah right. 
JD:Love. 
JD:I don't know why you picked that.
JD:Seems kind of limited in terms of research.
decisionBranch
Isn’t it better to be focused?
I disagree.
endDecision
startBranch3.1
JD:Focus is fine, but I think studying a single emotion is constraining.
JD:I mean, what are we supposed to ask about?
JD:“What is love?”
[name]:Baby don’t hurt me.
JD:I’m serious.
JD:Why make it more difficult for ourselves?
[name]:Well what did you want to study?
JD:I don’t know. 
JD:How about the psychology of sarcasm?
[name]:Wait, is that a serious suggestion or are you being sarcastic?
JD:I don’t know. 
JD:Am I?
[name]:I don’t know. . .
[name]:Are you?
JD:Exactly.
[name]:. . .
[name]:I don’t like that idea.
backToMain
startBranch3.2
JD:Really?
[name]:I think there’s a lot of different facets to it.
[name]:“How do we define love?”
[name]:“How does love impact our lives?”
JD:“Why does it end?
[name]:Dark.
JD:Just looking for different facets.

JD:Okay.
JD:Why don’t we brainstorm some questions back and forth and test them out?
JD:I’ll start.
JD:“What is your fondest memory of a loved one?”
JD:So now you can answer it,
JD:and based on the kind of response you give,
JD:we can decide if we think it’s an effective question.
JD:So,
JD:What is your fondest memory of a loved one?

When I went to a baseball game with my parents. 
When I went to the park with my ex. 
When I went to a museum with my older brother.

[name]:Well,
[name]:it wasn’t really at the game itself.
[name]:My favorite part of sporting events is the food from the vendors.
[name]:My dad got tickets for us from his job,
[name]:and I agreed to go so I could get a soft pretzel and one of those popcorn bowls shaped like a hat.
[name]:When we got there, the pretzel stand was closed, and I was pretty disappointed.
[name]:But after the game my parents decided to stop at a diner.
[name]:My mom got to talking to me about how Grandma was a huge baseball fan.
[name]:She said that as a kid, they would save up these box tops 
[name]:that when you collected 10 of them and sent them in, 
[name]:they would send you tickets to a baseball game.
[name]:My mom’s mom died when she was kind of young,
[name]:but she remembered looking forward to grocery shopping with her every week so they could get more box tops.
[name]:I guess that was the first time I really felt like I was seeing her as a donut, and not just my mom.

[name]:There were a lot of bees, because it was spring.
[name]:I’m terrified of bugs,
[name]:but my date didn’t know that at the time.
[name]:One flew over and started buzzing around the strawberry ice cream I’d bought,
[name]:and I got so scared that I threw the cone just to get it away from me.
[name]:It hit my ex right in the face, and dripped all over their shirt.
[name]:I was completely mortified and had no idea what to do.
[name]:But then they just laughed and said,
[name]:“It’s alright, I look great in pink!”
[name]:Then they shared the rest of their cone with me.

[name]:He’s nine years older than me, so he started college when I was nine.
[name]:When my parents and I came to visit him once, he took us to this museum near campus.
[name]:The place had a lot of big statues and pieces of art,
[name]:so we thought it would be fun to play hide and seek.
[name]:It was my turn to seek first, so I counted to 100 and started looking.
[name]:The place got more crowded as time went on,
[name]:and there were so many different rooms and hallways that after 10 minutes of looking I got really stressed and upset.
[name]:I sat down on a bench and almost started to cry,
[name]:but then my brother popped out from behind a statue in the same room
and rushed over to me.
[name]:When I asked him how he found me so fast,
[name]:he said that he’d followed me around to each room I was searching and re-hid in there because he didn’t want me to get lost.

Don’t treat them as data points, right?
It’s good for science.

JD:what’s your question?
My question. . .

What do you care about the most?
What are you most afraid of?
What is your strongest regret?

JD:Um. . .
JD:I don’t really know how to answer that right now.
[name]:Aw, come on!
[name]:I answered your question.
JD:That’s enough for today.
JD:We can’t think about this too seriously until we do the literature review anyway.
J.D. and I drafted the rest of our questions in silence.
