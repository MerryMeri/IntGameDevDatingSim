OLDIE:Here’s your tea.
[name]:Thanks.
OLDIE:You should drink it while it’s still hot.
[name]:I don’t want to burn myself.
OLDIE:If you wait too long, you’ll miss out on half the experience.
[name]:Well thanks for having me over.
[name]:I’ve never had finger sandwiches before.
[name]:You even cut off the crusts.
OLDIE:Of course I cut off the crusts.
OLDIE:Are you kidding?
OLDIE:Weren’t you impressed by the shapes?
[name]:Shapes?
OLDIE:Half of them are leaves, the others are flowers.
OLDIE:So’s the one you’re eating!
[name]:Oh.
decisionBranch
That’s fun. 
Wow! 
endDecision
startBranch1
[name]:They're nice.
[name]:But does the shape really make a difference?
OLDIE:Obviously it adds to the experience.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:I see it now.
[name]:How cute!
[name]:The shape really. . .shapes my whole experience.
OLDIE:That’s what I’m saying.

OLDIE:Anyway, you’re welcome.
OLDIE:But I do have ulterior motives.
OLDIE:The magazine recently held a popularity poll and I was the winner.
OLDIE:A lot of the votes were mailed with fan letters, so I was hoping you could help me answer them.
[name]:Oh!
[name]:So they liked the new direction you decided to take the story in?
OLDIE:No.
OLDIE:They didn’t end up publishing that one.
OLDIE:This was based on my work from last year.
[name]:Oh sorry.
decisionBranch
That must’ve been disappointing. 
But this is still good news. 
endDecision
startBranch1		
OLDIE:I’m not that upset about it.
OLDIE:I guess it was too much to expect them to be okay with a big change like that.
OLDIE:They can’t print something they don’t think will sell.

startBranch2
OLDIE:I’m glad to be popular.
OLDIE:But I’m being praised now for something I wrote so long ago that I feel completely disconnected from it.
OLDIE:It doesn’t really feel like I even wrote it.
OLDIE:Meanwhile my current stuff is being ignored.
OLDIE:I guess it’s bittersweet.
backToMain

OLDIE:So I have all these letters.
OLDIE:All you need to do is skim them and write a little thanks, and then I’ll sign them.
[name]:Okay, that’s easy enough.
[name]:What should I do if they ask a question?
OLDIE:Just let me know and I’ll answer it.
[name]:Sounds good.
[name]:Let’s see.
[name]:Here’s one.
[name]:“Old Fashioned Donut,”
[name]:“I’ve been a huge fan of your work for a while now”
[name]:“Sending lots of love and support.”
[name]:“- Chocolate Frosted Donut”
[name]:Wow!
[name]:So sweet.
[name]:Are they all like this?
OLDIE:Most likely not.
[name]:Why so negative?
OLDIE:I don’t know.
OLDIE:It can go either way.
OLDIE:Listen to this.
OLDIE:“Dear Old Fashioned Donut,”
OLDIE:“I used to like some of your early stuff”
OLDIE:“But all of your writing these days feels kind of hollow.”
OLDIE:“I don’t see any heart in it at all.”
OLDIE:“I hope to see you turn things around soon.”
OLDIE:“Best,”
OLDIE:“A concerned fan”
[name]:Did they seriously sign it like that?
OLDIE:Look!
[name]:Okay yeah, that’s kind of rough.
[name]:But you shouldn’t let a couple bad reviews keep you down.
[name]:Your stuff is obviously popular for a reason.
[name]:Even this person said they were a fan.
OLDIE:Did you hear all the other words?
OLDIE:They’re disappointed.
OLDIE:They didn’t even try to hide it.
OLDIE:I honestly would’ve preferred that they just told me I suck.
OLDIE:Then at least I could write it off.
OLDIE:But this is so specific, how can they not be right?
[name]:Come on!
[name]:You’re the writer.
[name]:You don’t have to rethink your whole story because of a couple of comments.
[name]:Everyone has their own tastes.
OLDIE:I can’t just ignore them either.
OLDIE:The stories are for them.
OLDIE:If they’re unhappy and I ignore it, then what’s even the point?
[name]:Maybe if you take the good and the bad, then you can see both what’s working in the story and what’s not?
[name]:Let’s try it.
[name]:Okay, this letter says,
[name]:“Old Fashioned Donut,”
[name]:“I appreciate the way that your stories communicate your characters’ feelings,”
[name]:“but the endings are always hit or miss for me.”
[name]:“At times they can feel a bit sappy and unoriginal.”
[name]:“I’d like to see you write something more exciting and unexpected.”
[name]:“I was also wondering, where do you get your inspiration to write?”
[name]:“Sincerely,”
[name]:“Boston Kreme”
OLDIE:Okay so the endings are sappy and unoriginal.
OLDIE:And they think my writing is boring and predictable.
[name]:Wait, they didn’t say that last part.
OLDIE:But that’s basically what they said.
[name]:They also said they like the way you write your characters!
[name]:That’s good!
OLDIE:They said they “appreciate” it.
OLDIE:That’s like a step below “like”.
[name]:You don’t have to take it that literally.
OLDIE:So what then?
OLDIE:Am I suppose to take it literally, or do I extrapolate?
[name]:Maybe you can use what they say as more of a clue to point you at how to critique your own work. 
[name]:And then you can draw your own conclusions.
[name]:So instead of, “It’s boring, make it exciting”,
[name]:be like, “the end is uninteresting, I wonder why that is?”
[name]:And then you can find a solution.
OLDIE:Hmph.
OLDIE:Maybe.
OLDIE:What was their question again?
[name]:“Where do you get your inspiration to write?”
OLDIE:I should probably say something like, “It’s all thanks to my loving fans”, right?

Just be honest.
Keep it simple.

[name]:If you make something up like that it might feel kind of fake.
OLDIE:But I don’t really know how to answer.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:Talk about how you got started writing.
[name]:I think people would enjoy hearing that.
OLDIE:I don’t think it’s really that interesting.
backToMain
mainContinue
[name]:Don't overthink it.
[name]:It’s a fan letter, they probably want to hear what you really think.
[name]:Be yourself and the answer will come naturally.
OLDIE:Okay I’ll try.
Old Fashioned Donut and I continued to answer fan letters.
