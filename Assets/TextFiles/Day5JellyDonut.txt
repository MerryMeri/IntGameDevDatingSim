[name]:Why are we recruiting here?
JD:Well, we know we have to focus on college students because that’s who we have at our disposal.
[name]:Okay sure, but why here here?
[name]:This is a thoroughfare.
[name]:Donuts are running to class, not stopping to have a chat.
[name]:There’s nowhere to sit!
JD:Well the dining hall’s closed today, so that’s out.
[name]:Okay.
JD:And we can’t use the library because they kicked us out.
[name]:What?
[name]:They didn’t kick us out.
[name]:They suggested we try out here because it’s crowded and other donuts wouldn’t mind us being loud.
[name]:. . .Oh, they kicked us out.
JD:Mhm.
JD:You’re a real glass half full type.
[name]:What about the student center?
[name]:Donuts hang around there all day.
JD:Ugh, I don’t wanna go there.
[name]:Why not?
JD:I just don’t want to. Do I have to explain?
decisionBranch
Are you okay?
It would help.

JD:I’m fine,
JD:I’m good.
JD:Why do you ask?
[name]:I just thought, after the other day-
JD:I don't wanna talk about it.
JD:Let's just stay on task.

JD:It’s just crowded,
JD:and there’s a million donuts, 
JD:and a bunch of clubs are probably meeting there right now.
[name]:Isn’t that exactly what we want?

JD:Fine, whatever.
JD:Let’s go to the student center.
JD:But you can do the heavy lifting.
[name]:Oh look, the music club’s performing.
[name]:I bet we could get some donuts from there.
JD:Okay, you can.
JD:I’ll wait over here.
[name]:What are you gonna do?
JD:I’ll um, hang a flyer on the bulletin board.
[name]:Okay, that’s a good idea.
[name]:This place is really lively!
[name]:Why don’t you like it here again?
JD:. . .
[name]:The lounge piano is free.
[name]:I love that thing.
[name]:We could sing a song about the wonder of qualitative research.
[name]:That’d turn a few heads.
JD:Are you even taking this seriously?
[name]:I am.
[name]:I’m brainstorming, and trying to keep us motivated.
[anem]:What about you?
JD:What?
JD:I’m helping.
[name]:What’s going on?
[name]:You just seem a little. . .
JD:Perturbed?
[name]:Yeah, or upset?
JD:I’m not upset!
[name]:. . ?
JD:It’s really nothing.
[name]:I doubt that.
JD:Do you really wanna know?
decisionBranch
Nah, nevermind. 
Yes, of course.

JD:Then why did you ask?

[name]:Please tell me.

JD:This place reminds me of my ex.
[name]:Oh, I see.
[name]:Who were they?
JD:Their name was Cruller.
JD:We dated for the first five months of sophomore year.
[name]:What happened?
JD:They were going to study abroad in the spring and decided to end things.
decisionBranch
Was it mutual? 
That must have been tough. 
endDecision
startBranch1
JD:I guess the short answer is no.
backToMain
startBranch2
JD:Yeah, I was pretty beat up about it.

mainContinue
JD:We said we were gonna try to do the long distance thing, 
JD:but after a few weeks they just sort of faded out of existence.
[name]:They ghosted you?
JD:It was more like a haunting.
[name]:Oof.
JD:There was no closure, so it felt kind of impossible to let go.
JD:I kept thinking I was seeing them everywhere.
JD:Our old table in the cafeteria, the park we used to visit sometimes. . .
[name]:and here?
JD:Yeah. 
JD:We used to hang out here a lot.
JD:Pretty pathetic, huh?
decisionBranch
Yeah, you’re a mess.
No, it’s okay.
endDecision
startBranch1
JD:That’s what I thought.
[name]:I just mean, why get so stuck in the past?
JD:It’s not like I don’t want to move on.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:I mean it’s not that crazy.
[name]:They still go to school here, don’t they?
JD:I mean, probably?
JD:I haven’t spoken to them since.
backToMain
mainContinue
JD:I’m fine.
JD:There’s no point in avoiding this place forever.
JD:I just have to get over it.
decisionBranch
We should do something fun.
Maybe you should think on it. 
endDecision
startBranch1
[name]:If it were me, I probably would’ve spent a lot of time agonizing over it.
[name]:But after a certain point you’re just beating yourself up.
JD:You're right, this is fun.
JD:I feel better, let's stop now.
[name]:Let me finish!
[name]:I was saying, don't underestimate the power of distraction.
[name]:Maybe you just need to remember how fun it is here.
[name]:Make new memories!
JD:Yeah, I think that’s a good idea.
JD:But what should we do?
[name]:I could play the 2 songs I know on piano repeatedly until you’re so annoyed you forget all about Cruller!
JD:Hahah.
JD:I actually play a little piano.
[name]:Oh! 
[name]:Well then, after you.
J.D. and I spent the rest of the afternoon at the piano.
startBranch2
JD:What do you mean?
[name]:Well,
[name]:if you haven’t been together for a while and you’re still upset about it, maybe you should try to figure out why?
[name]:If you ignore whatever it is that’s upsetting you about it, you’re probably gonna continue feeling that upsetment in the back of your head.
[name]:If you take the time to really process it, maybe it’ll become easier to deal with.
JD:That makes sense.
JD:But I just don’t know how to think about it anymore.
JD:I feel like I’m all thought out.
[name]:I’ll talk about it with you if you want.
[name]:Maybe an outside perspective could be helpful.
JD:Hm. . .
JD:Alright. 
JD:But please stop me if I’m boring you to death.
J.D. and I spent the rest of the afternoon talking.
