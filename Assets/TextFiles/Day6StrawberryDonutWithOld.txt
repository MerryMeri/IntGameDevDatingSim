Berry:Hey, are you having fun?
Berry:It’s nice to get the staff together after work every now and then, right?
decisionBranch
Yeah it is. 
I’m a little bored.

startBranch1
[name]:It’s fun getting to know everyone better.

startBranch2
Berry:Oh that’s too bad.
Berry:I can see how this might feel like more of an obligation.

Berry:Maybe we should play some kind of game.
Berry:Like an icebreaker.
[name]:Sure.
[name]:What kind of game were you thinking?
Berry:How about we draw pictures and the other person has to guess what it is?
Berry:I have a notebook and pen in my bag.
[name]:Oh that sounds fun!
Berry:Great!
Berry:Okay, I’ll go.
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut started drawing a couple of lines onto the paper.
Berry:Start guessing!
[name]:Oh okay!
[name]:Well I think it looks kind of like. . .
decisionBranch
A dog
A pancake breakfast
Me
endDecision
startBranch1
Berry:Yeah! It’s a dog!
Berry:How did you get that so quickly?
[name]:Well I saw the little face and ears and figured it was some cute animal, so I went with a popular choice.
Berry:Sound strategy.
Berry:I’ll have to try something a little harder for the next one.
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:Does it really look like that?
Berry:That’s not what I was going for, but it sounds delicious!
Berry:. . .
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut’s expression turned grim.
[name]:What’s wrong?!
Berry:. . . I’m hungry.
Berry:Anyway, it was actually supposed to be a dog.
backToMain
startBranch3
Berry:Whaat? Are you kidding?
Berry:Don’t be silly!
Berry:If it were you I would’ve put in a little more effort.
Berry:I didn’t draw any powdered sugar at all.
Berry:I think I’d need some colored pencils for that.
Berry:Wait, just give me five minutes, I’ll fix it!
[name]:That’s okay, don’t worry about it!
[name]:If it wasn’t me in the first place, don’t make yourself crazy.
Berry:Anyway, it was actually supposed to be a dog.

Berry:Okay, enough messing around.
Berry:This one’s for all the leftover soft pretzels at the diner.
Berry:Ready?!
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut looks deadly serious.
decisionBranch
O-okay!
I’m scared! 
endDecision
startBranch1
Berry:Yes! Let’s go!
Berry:Extreme Pictionary, no holds barred!
[name]:What does that mean?
Berry:It means I’m going to destroy you, and then eat a bunch of pretzels.
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:There’s no need to be scared!
Berry:I haven’t even started drawing yet.
[name]:Oh, haha. 
[name]:You’re right. 
[name]:Okay you can start!
Berry:Now you should be scared.
*shudder*

StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut started drawing lines, circles and x’s all over the paper.
[name]:Are you playing tic-tac-toe?
Berry:No!
Berry:But you’re kind of close.
[name]:How can I be close?
Berry:Just keep looking!
Berry:Look!
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut drew a picture of a basketball hoop and a ball.
[name]:It’s basketball!
Berry:Nooo, but it’s like that.
[name]:Wait, is the tic-tac-toe supposed to be like a play?
[name]:Like a basketball strategy?
[name]:That’s pretty smart!
Berry:No, it's just tic-tac-toe.
Berry:Don’t read too much into it.
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut drew a picture of a deck of cards.
Berry:Okay, I’m gonna give you one more guess.
[name]:Okay, is it. . .
decisionBranch
Things that are boring? 
Games? 
Gambling?
endDecision
startBranch1
Berry:You think basketball is boring?
[name]:No, I’m just terrible at it so it’s hard for me to enjoy.
[name]:It’s exciting to watch though.
Berry:Aw, maybe if you learned to play you’d like it more.
Berry:I used to play back in high school.
[name]:Really?
Berry:I wasn’t like on a team or anything.
Berry:We just played on the weekends sometimes.
Berry:Me and a few friends.
Berry:We should play sometime!
Berry:But anyway, I was actually trying to draw different kinds of games.
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:Yes!
Berry:It was games!
Berry:Wow, you did such a good job.
Berry:I tried to throw you off by drawing stuff from different mediums, but you totally got it.
backToMain
startBranch3
Berry:Gambling? 
[name]:Yeah. 
[name]:Like poker, or betting on a basketball game?
Berry:Do you bet on tic-tac-toe?
[name]:I thought maybe all the weird marks were like keeping track of bets or something.
Berry:You’ve never gambled a day in your life, have you?
Berry:Anyway, I was actually trying to draw different kinds of games.
backToMain
mainContinue
[name]:That was pretty fun!
Berry:You should try to draw one too.
[name]:Okay, I’ll try.
I took the paper from StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut and started to draw.
???:Hey.
When I looked up from the paper, I saw the stranger’s voice belonged to Old Fashioned Donut.
Oldie:How’s it going?
Oldie:What are you doing here?
[name]:I’m just here with some friends from work.
[name]:What are you doing here?
[name]:Isn’t your deadline coming up soon?
Oldie:Of course you remembered that.
Oldie:I was suffering a bit of writer’s block, so I decided to get out of the house to clear my head.
Oldie:It’s all part of the process.
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut shifted uncomfortably.
[name]:Oh! Sorry.
[name]:This is my friend from work, StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut.
Oldie:Nice to meet you.
Oldie:If I’d known you had a job,
Oldie:I wouldn’t have asked you to help out with my writing so often.
Oldie:I don’t know how you make time for all of it.
decisionBranch
I told you I have a job. (lie) 
I must’ve forgotten to mention it. 
endDecision
startBranch1
Oldie:No, I don’t think you did.
Oldie:I would’ve remembered.
[name]:Oh, really?
[name]:I guess I was mistaken.
[name]:I was sure I mentioned it.
Berry:Um don’t worry about it, it’s not important.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:I guess it just never came up.
Berry:That’s fine, it doesn’t matter.

Berry:So how do you know each other?
[name]:We live in the same apartment complex.
Oldie:I write stories for a weekly magazine.
Oldie:And since Player Name and I get along so well, I sometimes have them help me out.
Berry:Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun!
Oldie:I enjoy it. 
Oldie:Though considering it’s a job, it still has its challenges.
Berry:No, of course.
Berry:I didn’t mean to say that it didn’t.
Oldie:Don’t worry about it.
Oldie:Who am I to complain?
Oldie:Working in food service must be exhausting.
Berry:Yeah.
Berry:I’m actually the manager.
Oldie:Oh!
Oldie:I’m sorry, you’re just so young.
Oldie:I hope I haven’t said anything that could get [name] in trouble.
[name]:No, it’s not like that.
[name]:StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut is just the interim manager.
Berry:!
[name]:I mean-
[name]:We’re friends.
Oldie:Oh I see.
Oldie:That’s nice that you’re close with your employees.
Berry:Y-yeah.
[name]:Anyway, we were just playing a game.
[name]:Do you wanna play with us?
Oldie:I don’t know, 
Oldie:I was hoping to get more work done while I was here.
Old Fashioned Donut held up a notebook and a pen.
[name]:Oh okay.
Oldie:But you know, if you don’t mind I could use some help coming up with ideas.
Berry:How can we help?
Oldie:Have you heard of the game “One Word Story”?
Oldie:I use it sometimes when I get stuck, but it works better with more people.
Oldie:We try to tell a story by each contributing one word at a time.

Let’s try it!
I don’t know. . .

Oldie:No, that was really good.
Oldie:I thought the twist at the end was great.
Oldie:I think I’ll be able to use that in my story.
Oldie:You really have a knack for this.

Though I was sure I said it loudly
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut made no indication that they’d heard me.
They walked over to another table full of our co-workers, and we didn’t talk for the rest of the night.
