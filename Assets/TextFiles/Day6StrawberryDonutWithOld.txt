BERRY:Hey, are you having fun?
BERRY:It’s nice to get the staff together after work every now and then, right?
decisionBranch
Yeah it is. 
I’m a little bored.

[name]:It’s fun getting to know everyone better.

startBranch2
BERRY:Oh that’s too bad.
BERRY:I can see how this might feel like more of an obligation.
backToMain

BERRY:Maybe we should play some kind of game.
BERRY:Like an icebreaker.
[name]:Sure.
[name]:What kind of game were you thinking?
BERRY:How about we draw pictures and the other person has to guess what it is?
BERRY:I have a notebook and pen in my bag.
[name]:Oh that sounds fun!
BERRY:Great!
BERRY:Okay, I’ll go.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut started drawing a couple of lines onto the paper.
BERRY:Start guessing!
[name]:Oh okay!
[name]:Well I think it looks kind of like. . .

A dog -->
A pancake breakfast -->
Me -->
endDecision
startBranch1
BERRY:Yeah! It’s a dog!
BERRY:How did you get that so quickly?
[name]:Well I saw the little face and ears and figured it was some cute animal, so I went with a popular choice.
BERRY:Sound strategy.
BERRY:I’ll have to try something a little harder for the next one.
backToMain
startBranch2
BERRY:Does it really look like that?
BERRY:That’s not what I was going for, but it sounds delicious!
BERRY:. . .
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut’s expression turned grim.
[name]:What’s wrong?!
BERRY:. . . I’m hungry.
BERRY:Anyway, it was actually supposed to be a dog.
backToMain
startBranch3
BERRY:Whaat? Are you kidding?
BERRY:Don’t be silly!
BERRY:If it were you I would’ve put in a little more effort.
BERRY:I didn’t draw any powdered sugar at all.
BERRY:I think I’d need some colored pencils for that.
BERRY:Wait, just give me five minutes, I’ll fix it!
[name]:That’s okay, don’t worry about it!
[name]:If it wasn’t me in the first place, don’t make yourself crazy.
BERRY:Anyway, it was actually supposed to be a dog.

BERRY:Okay, enough messing around.
BERRY:This one’s for all the leftover soft pretzels at the diner.
BERRY:Ready?!
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut looks deadly serious.
decisionBranch
O-okay!
I’m scared! 
endDecision
startBranch1
BERRY:Yes! Let’s go!
BERRY:Extreme Pictionary, no holds barred!
[name]:What does that mean?
BERRY:It means I’m going to destroy you, and then eat a bunch of pretzels.
backToMain
startBranch2
BERRY:There’s no need to be scared!
BERRY:I haven’t even started drawing yet.
[name]:Oh, haha. 
[name]:You’re right. 
[name]:Okay you can start!
BERRY:Now you should be scared.
*shudder*

Strawberry Sprinkled Donut started drawing lines, circles and x’s all over the paper.
[name]:Are you playing tic-tac-toe?
BERRY:No!
BERRY:But you’re kind of close.
[name]:How can I be close?
BERRY:Just keep looking!
BERRY:Look!
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut drew a picture of a basketball hoop and a ball.
[name]:It’s basketball!
BERRY:Nooo, but it’s like that.
[name]:Wait, is the tic-tac-toe supposed to be like a play?
[name]:Like a basketball strategy?
[name]:That’s pretty smart!
BERRY:No, it's just tic-tac-toe.
BERRY:Don’t read too much into it.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut drew a picture of a deck of cards.
BERRY:Okay, I’m gonna give you one more guess.
[name]:Okay, is it. . .
decisionBranch
Things that are boring? 
Games? 
Gambling?
endDecision
startBranch1
BERRY:You think basketball is boring?
[name]:No, I’m just terrible at it so it’s hard for me to enjoy.
[name]:It’s exciting to watch though.
BERRY:Aw, maybe if you learned to play you’d like it more.
BERRY:I used to play back in high school.
[name]:Really?
BERRY:I wasn’t like on a team or anything.
BERRY:We just played on the weekends sometimes.
BERRY:Me and a few friends.
BERRY:We should play sometime!
BERRY:But anyway, I was actually trying to draw different kinds of games.
backToMain
startBranch2
BERRY:Yes!
BERRY:It was games!
BERRY:Wow, you did such a good job.
BERRY:I tried to throw you off by drawing stuff from different mediums, but you totally got it.
backToMain
startBranch3
BERRY:Gambling? 
[name]:Yeah. 
[name]:Like poker, or betting on a basketball game?
BERRY:Do you bet on tic-tac-toe?
[name]:I thought maybe all the weird marks were like keeping track of bets or something.
BERRY:You’ve never gambled a day in your life, have you?
BERRY:Anyway, I was actually trying to draw different kinds of games.
backToMain
mainContinue
[name]:That was pretty fun!
BERRY:You should try to draw one too.
[name]:Okay, I’ll try.
I took the paper from Strawberry Sprinkled Donut and started to draw.
???:Hey.
When I looked up from the paper, I saw the stranger’s voice belonged to Old Fashioned Donut.
OLDIE:How’s it going?
OLDIE:What are you doing here?
[name]:I’m just here with some friends from work.
[name]:What are you doing here?
[name]:Isn’t your deadline coming up soon?
OLDIE:Of course you remembered that.
OLDIE:I was suffering a bit of writer’s block, so I decided to get out of the house to clear my head.
OLDIE:It’s all part of the process.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut shifted uncomfortably.
[name]:Oh! Sorry.
[name]:This is my friend from work, Strawberry Sprinkled Donut.
OLDIE:Nice to meet you.
OLDIE:If I’d known you had a job,
OLDIE:I wouldn’t have asked you to help out with my writing so often.
OLDIE:I don’t know how you make time for all of it.
decisionBranch
I told you I have a job. (lie) 
I must’ve forgotten to mention it. 
endDecision
startBranch1
OLDIE:No, I don’t think you did.
OLDIE:I would’ve remembered.
[name]:Oh, really?
[name]:I guess I was mistaken.
[name]:I was sure I mentioned it.
BERRY:Um don’t worry about it, it’s not important.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:I guess it just never came up.
BERRY:That’s fine, it doesn’t matter.

BERRY:So how do you know each other?
[name]:We live in the same apartment complex.
OLDIE:I write stories for a weekly magazine.
OLDIE:And since Player Name and I get along so well, I sometimes have them help me out.
BERRY:Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun!
OLDIE:I enjoy it. 
OLDIE:Though considering it’s a job, it still has its challenges.
BERRY:No, of course.
BERRY:I didn’t mean to say that it didn’t.
OLDIE:Don’t worry about it.
OLDIE:Who am I to complain?
OLDIE:Working in food service must be exhausting.
BERRY:Yeah.
BERRY:I’m actually the manager.
OLDIE:Oh!
OLDIE:I’m sorry, you’re just so young.
OLDIE:I hope I haven’t said anything that could get [name] in trouble.
[name]:No, it’s not like that.
[name]:Strawberry Sprinkled Donut is just the interim manager.
BERRY:!
[name]:I mean-
[name]:We’re friends.
OLDIE:Oh I see.
OLDIE:That’s nice that you’re close with your employees.
BERRY:Y-yeah.
[name]:Anyway, we were just playing a game.
[name]:Do you wanna play with us?
OLDIE:I don’t know, 
OLDIE:I was hoping to get more work done while I was here.
Old Fashioned Donut held up a notebook and a pen.
[name]:Oh okay.
OLDIE:But you know, if you don’t mind I could use some help coming up with ideas.
BERRY:How can we help?
OLDIE:Have you heard of the game “One Word Story”?
OLDIE:I use it sometimes when I get stuck, but it works better with more people.
OLDIE:We try to tell a story by each contributing one word at a time.

OLDIE:I thought the twist at the end was great.
OLDIE:I think I’ll be able to use that in my story.
OLDIE:You really have a knack for this.

BERRY:Anyway, good luck with your work.
OLDIE:Thanks.

Though I was sure I said it loudly
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut made no indication that they’d heard me.
They walked over to another table full of our co-workers, and we didn’t talk for the rest of the night.
