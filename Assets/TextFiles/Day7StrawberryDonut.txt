I haven’t seen Strawberry Sprinkled Donut during my last several shifts.
I hope everythings okay.
Berry:Oh, [name].
Berry:I didn’t know you were closing tonight.
[name]:Hey!
[name]:Yeah, someone asked me to cover their shift.
Berry:Oh alright.
[name]:It’s good to see you.
[name]:I feel like we haven't spoken in a while.
Berry:Oh yeah, sorry about that.
Berry:I’ve just been super busy lately.
[name]:Oh, right.
[name]:I get that. . .
[name]:So how’s everything?
Berry:Pretty normal, you know.
Berry:I actually got a job offer from one of my undergrad professors.
[name]:Oh, wow!
Berry:Yeah, they heard I was doing my masters there,
Berry:and they wanted me to come be a T.A. for some of their art classes.
[name]:That’s great!
Berry:Yeah but if I took it,
Berry:I wouldn’t have enough time to help out my parents and keep working here.
Berry:And it pays less than here too, so I’m probably not gonna take it.
Berry:My dad thinks it’s not worth the worry.
[name]:What?
[name]:But. . .
Berry:What?
Berry:You have an opinion?
[name]:I think you should take it.
Berry:Why?

Because it’s a great opportunity!
Because it’s your dream.

Berry:I don’t really know about that.
Berry:I’d just be a teaching assistant.
Berry:And I’d make less money for probably more work.

Berry:My dream?
Berry:What do you know about my dreams?
Berry:You’re being kind of presumptuous right now.

[name]:I thought you loved being an artist.
Berry:So what?
Berry:That doesn’t mean I can be one.
[name]:But this is your chance.
[name]:It’s like a professional connection!
Berry:My chance to do what?
Berry:Go broke and stress myself out even more while I’m still trying to finish a degree?
Berry:Woo!
Berry:Sign me up.
[name]:Is that what you really think?
Berry:Excuse me?
Berry:My job is just a paycheck, it doesn’t mean anything.
Berry:I don’t care what I do as long as I can get by and take care of my family.
[name]:You know, you don’t have to please everybody.
Berry:What does that mean?
[name]:It means that when you’re in a difficult situation 
[name]:you’d rather bury your emotions than tell anyone how you feel.
[name]:And then you end up putting everyone else’s needs before your own.
Berry:Woah! That's a bit much.
Berry:What are you even saying?
[name]:I can see it in the way you act.
[name]:The way you handle customers, and your family, and now me.
[name]:It’s like you’re so afraid of fighting anyone that you won’t express yourself at all.
[name]:You insist that you’re okay with things, when you’re not.
Berry:I don't know what you’re talking about.
Berry:Why are you making this so personal?
Berry:You keep saying crazy things about me that you don’t even know are true.
Berry:I try to express myself all the time, it’s not my fault that nobody listens.
[name]:I’m sorry, I shouldn't have overstepped.
[name]:I just don’t want to see you talk yourself out of doing something that could make you happy.
Berry:It doesn’t matter how I feel about things if I can’t change them.
[name]:But people who care about you will want to know how you feel. 
[name]:And they’ll want to be able to make you happy, and feel okay.
Berry:What does that mean?
[name]:I care about you.

Berry:!
[name]:And I think that if you want the job, you should take it.
Berry:. . .
Berry:Just saying that I should “follow my dreams” doesn’t make it any more feasible.
Berry:Regardless of how I feel, I have obligations.
Berry:You should be sensitive to that.
[name]:I know.
[name]:I know, you’re right.
[name]:I’m sorry.
[name]:I guess I just want you to know that, if this job will make you happy
[name]:I’ll support you in any way I can.
Berry:. . .
Berry:It’s also that. . .
Berry:I didn’t want to have to quit here either.
[name]:Really?
[name]:I didn’t think you were that attached to this place.
Berry:I’m not, I just. . .
Berry:I never really liked it here, but for a while now it’s been a lot of fun.
[name]:It has for me too.
[name]:. . .
[name]:You know, whether you take the job or not, 
[name]:you don’t have to worry about me disappearing out of your life.
[name]:If you want me around, I’ll be around.
Berry:. . . 
Berry:Really?
[name]:Really.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut looked at me through watery eyes and smiled.
Berry:You’re a good Donut.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut and I spent the night dancing to music and joking around as we cleaned the restaurant.
