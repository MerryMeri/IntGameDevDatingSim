Okay, day one at the new job.
I was so nervous I got here a little too early.
Though I suppose being early is better than late.
But I don’t know who’s supposed to be training me.
I guess I can just stand here awkwardly until they find me like a lost puppy.
That’s probably a terrible impression to give off on my first day.
I know!
I’ll flag down one of the waiters and ask them for help!
Okay, waiter, waiter...
Where are all the waiters?
Come to think of it, there’s not really any customers here either.
Maybe the employees are back in the kitchen area.
I guess I could have a look.
I walked over to the kitchen door and stuck my head inside.
I hope this isn’t some kind of health code violation.
[name]:Hello? Anyone here?
[name]:...
Alright, I’m goin’ in!
[name]:Hi, is anyone here? 
[name]:I’m the new employee.
There’s no one back here either?
Berry:Hello?
Someone emerged from the walk-in freezer.
Berry:Oh! 
Berry:Hi, can I help you?
[name]:Yeah, I just transferred over from another branch and I’m supposed to start training today.
Berry:Oh you must be [name]!
Berry:I’m Strawberry Sprinkled Donut, I’m the interim-manager.
Berry:Nice to meet you!
Berry:You used to be at the Batter County branch right?
[name]:Yeah!
[name]:I moved to be closer to school.
Berry:Oh, you’re a student too?
Berry:Where do you go?
[name]:Fried Sweets University.
Berry:No way!
Berry:That’s where I go!
[name]:Really?
Berry:Yeah! 
Berry:I’m getting a masters in education.
[name]:On top of managing a restaurant...

Berry:We lost a couple of employees and the owner’s been kind of hard to get a hold of lately.
Berry:Planning some other business venture I think.
Berry:Since we’re low on staff right now, I've been taking care of pretty much everything myself.
Berry:But now that you’re here it should make things easier.

I’ll do my best!

Berry:Alright, I’ll show you the ropes.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut trained me how to run the restaurant.
After work, I went back to my apartment to finish moving in.
