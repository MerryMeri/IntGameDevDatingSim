*KNOCK*KNOCK*KNOCK*
Someone’s at the door.
Oldie:Hey, can we talk?
[name]:Yeah, come in.
[name]:How are you doing?
Oldie:I’m actually feeling a lot better.
[name]:Oh really?
[name]:That’s good!
[name]:What happened?
[name]:If you don't mind me asking.
[name]:Did you find a publisher for your book?
Oldie:Haha, no.
Oldie:I doubt that’s going to happen anytime soon.
[name]:Oh, so is it about your short stories?
Oldie:Kind of!
Oldie:Apparently the magazine got wind of what happened at my book reading, and now they’re dropping me.
Oldie:They can’t sell romance stories from a writer who’s sick of romance. 
[name]:Oh my god!
[name]:I’m so sorry.
Oldie:No, don’t be!
Oldie:It’s a good thing.
[name]:Why?
Oldie:I mean, we all knew it wasn’t working out.
Oldie:Me, the magazine, the fans.
Oldie:I kind of ran the course of my time there, and now I’m ready to move on.
Oldie:I announced I’d be stepping away after the next issue.
[name]:Wow.
[name]:What did the fans say?
Oldie:A lot of donuts were pretty upset about it.
Oldie:But you know, for once I actually feel good.
Oldie:I don't really mind starting over somewhere else, and now I can branch out without being afraid.

Oldie:Come on, I didn’t do anything.
Oldie:I know I can act like I know better than everyone, and I’m kind of stubborn.
Oldie:Looking back I don’t even know how you put up with it. . .
Oldie:I guess what I’m trying to say is,
Oldie:I couldn’t have gotten to the place that I’m in emotionally if it weren’t for you.
Oldie:I feel like I’ve become a better person ever since you moved in.

Oldie:Well we’ll have to see about that.
Oldie:Either way, I have to say thank you.
Oldie:In another time and place, a development like this probably would’ve destroyed me.
Oldie:But I feel a lot stronger ever since we became friends.

Oldie:. . .
Oldie:How’s that for a sappy ending, huh?
Oldie:It’s kind of my specialty.
Oldie:Anyway, I’m sorry for storming out of the reading.
Oldie:I must’ve seemed like such a kid.
Oldie:I really do appreciate everything you’ve done to help me, you have no idea.
Oldie:Do you think you can forgive me?
[name]:Of course.
Old Fashioned Donut broke out into a big smile.
Oldie:So can I make it up to you?
Oldie:I got new cookie cutters for the tea sandwiches.
Oldie:One’s shaped like a dinosaur and another is a smiley face.
Oldie:I also picked up a big cheese cake from a bakery.
Oldie:Oh, and some more tea.
[name]:Old Fashioned Donut, you know the way to my heart.
[name]:Now get me a fork.
Old Fashioned Donut and I enjoyed our tea together.
