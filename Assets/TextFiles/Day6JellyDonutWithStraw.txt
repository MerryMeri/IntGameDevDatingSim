[name]:It was nice of the professor to let us use the classroom for our interviews.
JD:Yeah. 
JD:It definitely beats having to meet them at the coffee shop in terms of privacy. 
JD:And it’s cheaper because we don't have to buy another drink every 20 minutes to keep the table.
[name]:True. 
[name]:But I do love those little mini muffins they have.
JD:I thought of that.
J.D. unveiled a tray of homemade cookies.
[name]:Oh my god.
JD:I thought the sugar would help donuts open up.
I looked over J.D.’s impressive spread of cookies and reached out to grab. . .

[name]:This cookie is really complex!
[name]:How did you have time to make this?
JD:It’s nothing.
JD:It's just a hobby.

startBranch2
[name]:This is excellent.
[name]:But if you really wanted donuts to open up you should've brought a bottle of something.
[name]:Haha, next time.

startBranch3
[name]:This is delicious!
[name]:I think this is your best idea yet.
JD:Well if being a researcher doesn’t work out, I plan on becoming the world’s most successful and mysterious candy maker.
[name]:Oh?
JD:But then when I get too old to run my magical factory, 
JD:I’ll send out invitations to 5 lucky children from all over the world for a job interview, 
JD:and then have them fight to the death.
[name]:You had me until the ending there.
JD:You can’t say that’s not exactly what that book was about.

[name]:So who are we meeting with today?
JD:A grad student named Strawberry Sprinkled Donut.
[name]:Did you say Strawberry Sprinkled Donut?!
JD:Yeah, why? Do you know them? 
[name]:Is that a conflict of interest?
JD:We might have to declare it as one.
JD:But since we’re students interviewing other students, its inevitable we might know some of them,
JD:so I think it’ll be okay.
*KNOCK*KNOCK*KNOCK* //(knocking sound effect)
JD:Oh, I guess they’re here.
[name]:Oh! Okay! 
[name]:This’ll be great!
*KNOCK*KNOCK*KNOCK* //(knocking sound effect)
JD:I’ll let them in.
It will be great.

So why do I feel so uneasy?
BERRY:Hi! 
BERRY:I’m here for the interview.
BERRY:Am I in the right place?
JD:Yup.
BERRY:Oh good. 
BERRY:I’ve never been to this building before, 
BERRY:I was worried I might get lost.
JD:We’ll be interviewing you. 
JD:I’m Jelly Donut, and that’s-
BERRY:Oh! 
BERRY:[name], is this your research project? 
BERRY:I had no idea. 
BERRY:That's so exciting! 
BERRY:How come you didn’t mention anything about it?
decisionBranch
It never came up. 
I didn’t think of it.

startBranch1	
[name]:I guess we keep so busy at work that it wasn’t really on my mind.
BERRY:Wow, you’re pretty good at compartmentalizing!
BERRY:I could use some of that.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:Sorry! 
[name]:I didn’t know you’d be interested in hearing about it.
BERRY:Whaat? 
BERRY:Of course I’d wanna hear! 
BERRY:You must be putting a lot of effort into this. 
BERRY:I don’t know how you stay so energetic at work on top of it.

JD:You two work together?
BERRY:Yeah! We work at the diner a few minutes from campus.
BERRY:We have really good pasta there, you should come by sometime!
JD:Oh yeah, cool.
BERRY:Oh yeah!
BERRY:Here’s the form you asked for by the way.
JD:Thank you.
JD:Oh, you forgot to fill out what college you’re in.
BERRY:Sorry, there wasn’t a box for the graduate school, so I wasn’t sure what to check.
JD:Oh sorry, I guess we should’ve thought of that.
BERRY:Don’t worry about it!
JD:So you’re a grad student?
BERRY:Yeah! 
[name]:Strawberry Sprinkled Donut is studying to become an elementary school teacher.
JD:That’s nice. 
JD:So you like kids?
BERRY:Of course! 
BERRY:Kids have a kind of honesty to them that I think is really admirable. 
BERRY:And they have great ideas too, because they’re less encumbered by expectations.
JD:Must be nice.
BERRY:Haha, I know right?
[name]:So how did you hear about the study?
BERRY:I saw a flyer on one of the cork boards outside my Childhood Development classroom.
JD:Oh, I didn’t think we put any there.
[name]:I put it there.
JD:Oh, you went on your own?
[name]:Yeah. . .
decisionBranch
I thought it would be a good idea to branch out. 
I didn’t want to take up more of your time. 
endDecision
startBranch1
[name]:Since we didn’t get to sign a lot of donuts up during class time, 
[name]:I hung up some more flyers around campus in between my classes.
JD:I guess class wasn’t that productive.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:I have class in that building anyway, so I figured I could take care of it myself.
JD:Oh right, of course.
JD:That makes sense.

JD:There’s cookies by the way.
JD:Would you like one?
BERRY:Ooh, thanks!
JD:Let’s get to the next question.
JD:“How do you know you love someone?”
BERRY:Wow. That’s kind of tough.
BERRY:Um. . .
BERRY:Hm.
BERRY:I think it’s kind of like,
BERRY:you’re comfortable around them, and you don’t feel afraid that they’re going to hurt you, because they’re always trying to raise you up.
BERRY:Does that sound too cliche?
JD:There are no wrong answers.
BERRY:I’ve never had a serious relationship, so it’s a little hard to answer. 
BERRY:But that’s what I think it’d be like.
JD:Well it doesn’t just have to be romantic relationships. 
JD:What about family?
BERRY:Oh, um. . .it’s. . .
BERRY:I’m sorry, I can't really think of anything.
BERRY:I mean, I guess it’s just hard to describe.
BERRY:I don't know how to explain it.
BERRY:I guess it's like being needed? 
BERRY:They look to me for help and advice and stuff.
JD:And what do you get out of that?
BERRY:Well, I guess it feels good to have other donuts value my opinions.
JD:Okay so you love them because they make you feel good about yourself?
JD:That makes sense.
BERRY:I wouldn't exactly put it like that.
BERRY:That makes me sound kind of shallow.
JD:Sorry I was just repeating what you said.
BERRY:That's not what I said. 
JD:I'm sorry, 
JD:you said it was hard to explain, so I was just trying to extrapolate.
JD:It sounds like they depend on you, and you like being depended on.
BERRY:That’s not how it is.
BERRY:If you don’t understand my situation, don’t force your perspective onto me.
JD:You’re right! 
JD:I'm sorry, forget I said anything.
BERRY:. . .
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut looks like they’re about to cry.
[name]:Are you okay?
BERRY:Oh god, I don’t know why I said that. 
BERRY:I have to go. 
BERRY:I’m sorry.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut fled the room.
[name]:Wait! 
[name]:Come back!
JD:Jesus, I’m such a jerk.
decisionBranch
It’s not your fault. 
It’s my fault. 
endDecision
startBranch1
[name]:I think they don’t like to talk about their family.
[name]:But you couldn’t have known.
JD:No. 
JD:They said it was complicated. 
JD:I should’ve paid more attention.
[name]:It’ll be okay. 
[name]:Let’s go find them.
JD:I should probably just go. 
JD:I’m obviously doing more harm than good.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:I know their family is a difficult subject, 
[name]:I should’ve said something.

JD:You know them better than I do. 
JD:I don’t know how much help I’m going to be.

With those parting words, J.D. left me alone in the classroom.
I should make sure Strawberry Sprinkled Donut is okay.
