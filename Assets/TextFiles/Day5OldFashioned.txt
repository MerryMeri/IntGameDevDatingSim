*KNOCK*KNOCK*KNOCK* //(knocking sound effect)
[name]:Hey Old Fashioned Donut.
[name]:I haven’t seen you around in a while, so I just wanted to check in and say hi.
[name]:How’s your writing going?
Oldie:. . .
No response?
[name]:Um, I got this new electric tea kettle.
[name]:I thought maybe we could try it out.
Oldie:. . .
[name]:Anyway,
[name]:if you’re busy I can come back another time.
I heard Old Fashioned Donut shift and then speak from behind the apartment door.
Oldie:What are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Oldie:Don’t you have class?
[name]:It’s Fried Day.
[name]:I have off.
Oldie:Well I’m busy.
Oldie:I don’t have time to play with you today.
[name]:You don’t have to make it sound like you’re my babysitter.
[name]:I was just worried about you.
[name]:But if you’re in a mood I’ll just stay out of your way.
Oldie:If you’re going to use that kettle, make sure you set it to the right temperature and time.
Oldie:Don’t just go with the presets, it’ll ruin it.
Oldie:You know what, forget it.
[name]:Did something happen?
Oldie:Everythings fine.
Oldie:I’m just busy.

Okay. I’ll leave you alone. 
Are you sure?

Oldie:. . . 
I started to walk back to my apartment, then I heard Old Fashioned Donut’s door open behind me.
Oldie:Just wait a second.
Oldie:Please.

Oldie:. . .
Oldie:No.
Old Fashioned Donut opened the door just enough that I could see their face.
They look distraught.	
[name]:Can I come in?

Oldie:You can come in.
Oldie:Don’t linger in the hallway.
[name]:So what’s up?
Oldie:. . .
Old Fashioned Donut handed me a folded piece of paper and flopped onto the couch.
I looked at the paper and started to read.
[name]:“Thank you for your submission to Bagel Publishing.”
[name]:“We have reviewed your novel, and we are unable to offer you a contract at this time.”
[name]:“Please-”
Oldie: You don’t have to read it outloud, you know.
[name]:Sorry.
[name]:. . .
[name]:I didn’t know you were trying to get a new novel published.
Oldie:Well, no one wants it, so it’s basically as if I haven’t.
Oldie:The only thing that’s changed is that now I feel even crappier.
Oldie:Wooo.
[name]:So one publisher turned it down.
[name]:There are a million others.
Oldie:That was the seventh one.
Oldie:There’s a stack of more rejections over there.
[name]:Well, did they give you a reason at least?
Oldie:They’re not obligated to.
Oldie:But I did get a couple.
Oldie:It’s all about how the work is flat and underdeveloped.
Oldie:They can’t “see my voice” in the work.
Oldie:But I don’t understand that, because I was just trying to write from the character’s perspective.
Oldie:I don’t know what I’m going to do.
Oldie:I should probably just stop.
[name]:You can’t stop!
decisionBranch
I think you’re doing great. 
I think you’re really brave.
endDecision 
startBranch1
[name]:You’re independent and industrious, and you work so hard at everything you do.
[name]:You should have more confidence in yourself.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:You put everything you have into your work everyday.
[name]:And even when you have to deal a lot of conflicting voices telling you what to do, you just keep trying harder.

[name]:There’s no way you’ll be able to create anything if you’re coming from a place of fear.
[name]:Sure criticism is important, but I think it’s also important to hold onto the faith that you have stories worth telling.
Oldie:Yeah right.
Oldie:I pushed myself so hard, 
Oldie:finished school early,
Oldie:threw away my chance to have any real experiences, because I told myself I was working toward the future.
Oldie:But the way things are now, it feels like it was all a waste.
Oldie:I can’t write anymore.
Oldie:My life is completely uninteresting, I have nothing new to say, and I have no idea what I’m even doing!
Oldie:. . .
Oldie:I feel like such a fraud.
[name]:You’re not a fraud.
Oldie:Pfff.
Oldie:You know what the stupidest part is?
Oldie:I don’t even feel like I’m enjoying myself anymore.
Oldie:I used to be so excited to write.
Oldie:I could just be myself and live out all the adventures I wished I was having.
Oldie:Now I feel like I’m always killing myself with work just to end up disappointing everybody.
[name]:I think I understand what you’re saying.
[name]:So before anyone had expectations for you, you felt freer to express yourself.
[name]:And now that you’re a professional, you’re getting too bogged down and it’s stopping you from being honest.
[name]:I think you should just let yourself be vulnerable.
Oldie:What do you mean?
[name]:Just like, you don’t have to put up such a front all the time.
[name]:There’s no such thing as perfection, and even if there were, there’s nothing interesting about it.
[name]:I mean, I don’t read that often, but I know I’m more interested in flaws, and gaps in characters' personalities.
[name]:I want to see the struggle.
Oldie:But the stories I write aren’t about me.
[name]:But the emotions must come from somewhere real, right?
[name]:That’s all you!
Oldie:Yeah.
Oldie:Yeah I guess you’re right.
Oldie:God, I can’t believe I’m complaining to you like this.
Oldie:I’m so embarrassed.
[name]:Come on.
[name]:You don’t have to be embarrassed.
[name]:I want you to succeed.
[name]:I see how much you care about your work so, as long as you want me to, I’ll do everything I can to help.
Oldie:Thank you, [name].
Oldie:You’re really something else.
[name]:It’s nothing.
Oldie:You want to stay for some tea?
[name]:I have the new kettle!
Oldie:Let’s just use mine.
[name]:Aw come on, take a risk!
Oldie:You can take a risk.
Oldie:I don’t want my nice tea leaves to go to waste.
[name]:Fine fine, sure.
[name]:I’ll put on the water.
I walked over to Old Fashioned Donut’s stove,
picked up the tea kettle and hid it behind my back.
[name]:Oh no!
[name]:The kettle’s missing, guess we’ll have to try the new one!
Oldie:What are you doing?
Oldie:I see you holding it.
[name]:Whaat? Nooo.
Old Fashioned Donut and I jokingly ran around the apartment as I tried to dispose of the old kettle.
