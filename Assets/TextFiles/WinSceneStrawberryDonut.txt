[name]:Can I look now?
Berry:No wait!
Berry:Don’t move yet.
Berry:I’m almost done.
[name]:I hope you got my good side.
Berry:They’re all good sides.
[name]:Don’t make me blush, you’ll have to repaint my face.
Berry:Worth it.
Berry:Alright!
Berry:I’m done!
Berry:Come take a look.
[name]:Wow!
[name]:That’s me!
[name]:Can I keep it?
Berry:After my class.
Berry:We’re doing watercolors in Portraits 1 right now, so I’m gonna use it as an example.
[name]:So this is what it feels like to be a star.
[name]:Step aside, Mona Lisa.
Berry:I don’t know if it’s that good, but you’re definitely a star.
[name]:It’s excellent!
[name]:Now all we have to do is stage a mysterious theft and reappearance.
[name]:Then it’ll be a sensation.
Berry:I think that only works when you steal something from the Louvre.
Berry:From here it doesn’t have quite the same impact.
Berry:But I appreciate your enthusiasm.
[name]:Ah, well.
[name]:I guess I’ll just have to brag to everyone I know until you get famous.
Berry:Alright then.
Berry:Let me just clean up here, and I’ll treat my number one fan to dinner.
[name]:I’ll help!
Berry:Oh, hold on.
Berry:My dad’s calling me.
[name]:Are you gonna be okay?
Berry:Yeah, don’t worry.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut answered the phone.
Berry:Hello?

Berry:Yeah I know.
Berry:Blueberry Cake said she’d handle it.
Berry:...
Berry:Uh-huh.
Berry:Don’t worry about it.
Berry:...
Berry:Okay, I gotta go.
Berry:Uh-huh, okay byeee.
[name]:That was fast.
[name]:Everything okay?
Berry:Yeah.
Berry:I got my sister to start picking up some of the slack at home.

Berry:Anyway, let’s get going.
Berry:I kind of want breakfast food.
