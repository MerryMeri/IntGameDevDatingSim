???:Welcome everyone, to the first weekly meeting of writers united.
???:Today we will be doing a read through of Crumb Cake Donut and Old Fashioned Donut’s first collaborative piece, “The Adventures of Strawberry and the Talking Door”.
Oldie:Thanks for coming with me.
[name]:Of course!
[name]:Wouldn't miss it.
[name]:Plus I live here so, can’t really get more convenient than this.
[name]:So how’d Crumb Cake Donut convince you to work on a radio play together?
Oldie:I actually asked them.
[name]:Are you kidding?
Oldie:Haha, no I’m serious.
Oldie:I figured if I’m going to start writing new stuff again, why be a snob about it?
[name]:Now I’m really impressed.
Oldie:So here’s your script.
[name]:Thanks.
[name]:...
Oldie:You can start whenever.
[name]:Oh!
[name]:I’m reading it?
Oldie:Is that okay?
[name]:Eh, why not?
Oldie:Okay, you have the first line.
[name]:Right!
[name]:Ahem.
[name]:“It began on a day like any other.”
[name]:“My close friend and companion Talking Door,”
[name]:“was regaling me with stories of their youth when I first saw it.”
[name]:“To my horror, Talking Door’s welcome mat had been stolen.”
[name]:“Thus, our investigation began.”
