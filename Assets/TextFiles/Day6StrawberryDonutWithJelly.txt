BERRY:Hey, are you having fun?
BERRY:It’s nice to get the staff together after work every now and then, right?
decisionBranch
Yeah it is. 
I’m a little bored.

startBranch2
BERRY:Oh that’s too bad.
BERRY:I can see how this might feel like more of an obligation.

BERRY:Maybe we should play some kind of game.
BERRY:Like an icebreaker.
[name]:Sure.
[name]:What kind of game were you thinking?
BERRY:How about we draw pictures and the other person has to guess what it is?
BERRY:I have a notebook and pen in my bag.
[name]:Oh that sounds fun!
BERRY:Great!
BERRY:Okay, I’ll go.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut started drawing a couple of lines onto the paper.
BERRY:Start guessing!
[name]:Oh okay!
[name]:Well I think it looks kind of like. . .

A dog -->
A pancake breakfast -->
Me -->
endDecision
startBranch1
BERRY:Yeah! It’s a dog!
BERRY:How did you get that so quickly?
[name]:Well I saw the little face and ears and figured it was some cute animal, so I went with a popular choice.
BERRY:Sound strategy.
BERRY:I’ll have to try something a little harder for the next one.
backToMain
startBranch2
BERRY:Does it really look like that?
BERRY:That’s not what I was going for, but it sounds delicious!
BERRY:. . .
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut’s expression turned grim.
[name]:What’s wrong?!
BERRY:. . . I’m hungry.
BERRY:Anyway, it was actually supposed to be a dog.
backToMain
startBranch3
BERRY:Whaat? Are you kidding?
BERRY:Don’t be silly!
BERRY:If it were you I would’ve put in a little more effort.
BERRY:I didn’t draw any powdered sugar at all.
BERRY:I think I’d need some colored pencils for that.
BERRY:Wait, just give me five minutes, I’ll fix it!
[name]:That’s okay, don’t worry about it!
[name]:If it wasn’t me in the first place, don’t make yourself crazy.
BERRY:Anyway, it was actually supposed to be a dog.

BERRY:Okay, enough messing around.
BERRY:This one’s for all the leftover soft pretzels at the diner.
BERRY:Ready?!
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut looks deadly serious.
decisionBranch
O-okay!
I’m scared! 
endDecision
startBranch1
BERRY:Yes! Let’s go!
BERRY:Extreme Pictionary, no holds barred!
[name]:What does that mean?
BERRY:It means I’m going to destroy you, and then eat a bunch of pretzels.
backToMain
startBranch2
BERRY:There’s no need to be scared!
BERRY:I haven’t even started drawing yet.
[name]:Oh, haha. 
[name]:You’re right. 
[name]:Okay you can start!
BERRY:Now you should be scared.
*shudder*

Strawberry Sprinkled Donut started drawing lines, circles and x’s all over the paper.
[name]:Are you playing tic-tac-toe?
BERRY:No!
BERRY:But you’re kind of close.
[name]:How can I be close?
BERRY:Just keep looking!
BERRY:Look!
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut drew a picture of a basketball hoop and a ball.
[name]:It’s basketball!
BERRY:Nooo, but it’s like that.
[name]:Wait, is the tic-tac-toe supposed to be like a play?
[name]:Like a basketball strategy?
[name]:That’s pretty smart!
BERRY:No, it's just tic-tac-toe.
BERRY:Don’t read too much into it.
Strawberry Sprinkled Donut drew a picture of a deck of cards.
BERRY:Okay, I’m gonna give you one more guess.
[name]:Okay, is it. . .
decisionBranch
Things that are boring? 
Games? 
Gambling?
endDecision
startBranch1
BERRY:You think basketball is boring?
[name]:No, I’m just terrible at it so it’s hard for me to enjoy.
[name]:It’s exciting to watch though.
BERRY:Aw, maybe if you learned to play you’d like it more.
BERRY:I used to play back in high school.
[name]:Really?
BERRY:I wasn’t like on a team or anything.
BERRY:We just played on the weekends sometimes.
BERRY:Me and a few friends.
BERRY:We should play sometime!
BERRY:But anyway, I was actually trying to draw different kinds of games.
backToMain
startBranch2
BERRY:Yes!
BERRY:It was games!
BERRY:Wow, you did such a good job.
BERRY:I tried to throw you off by drawing stuff from different mediums, but you totally got it.
backToMain
startBranch3
BERRY:Gambling? 
[name]:Yeah. 
[name]:Like poker, or betting on a basketball game?
BERRY:Do you bet on tic-tac-toe?
[name]:I thought maybe all the weird marks were like keeping track of bets or something.
BERRY:You’ve never gambled a day in your life, have you?
BERRY:Anyway, I was actually trying to draw different kinds of games.
backToMain

[name]:That was pretty fun!
BERRY:You should try to draw one too.
[name]:Okay, I’ll try.
I took the paper from Strawberry Sprinkled Donut and started to draw.
???:Hey.
When I looked up from the paper, I saw the stranger’s voice belonged to Jelly Donut.
[name]:Oh, hi!
JD:Sorry to interrupt.
[name]:No, that’s okay!
[name]:Um, Strawberry Sprinkled Donut this is my classmate Jelly Donut.
BERRY:Oh!
BERRY:You go to Fried Sweets?
BERRY:Me too!
JD:Oh cool.
JD:Well, I saw you and just wanted to say hi so, I’ll let you get back to it.
BERRY:Wait, are you here by yourself?
JD:Uh, yeah.
BERRY:You should sit with us!
BERRY:If you want.
BERRY:I’d love to meet one of [name]'s friends!
JD:Ah, yeah sure.
JD:Sounds good.
Jelly Donut pulled up a stool and sat down.
BERRY:I work with Player Name at the diner.
JD:Oh, I didn’t know you had a part-time job.
BERRY:You never mentioned it?

JD:. . . So, um
JD:What were you guys talking about?
[name]:Oh, we were just playing a drawing game.
JD:Oh cool, how do you play?
BERRY:Actually, I don’t think I have enough paper to keep playing this.
[name]:Oh that’s okay!
[name]:Um, should we play another game?
JD:Maybe we could do like 20 questions or something?
decisionBranch
That’d be great! 
Oh, well. . . 
endDecision
startBranch1
BERRY:Oh yeah, sure.
BERRY:Let’s do it.
JD:Oh if you don’t want to, that's fine.

BERRY:It sounds like fun.
backToMain
[name]:Okay, I’ll think of something first.

[name]:Okay, I got it.
JD:Is it a thing?
[name]:Yes!
BERRY:Is it an object?
JD:Can you hold it in your hand?
[name]:Yes you can, and I wouldn’t call it an object necessarily, but kind of.
JD:Is it a food?
[name]:Yes, it’s a food!
BERRY:Is it a pretzel?!

JD:Oh, is it ice cream?!
[name]:Yes! Good job!

JD:I just thought of it because of the time the ice-cream truck came by during Psych-
[name]:and Professor Maple stopped class so we could all get some?!
[name]:I know! That’s what I was thinking of! 
JD:That was so awesome.
[name]:Haha I know, I love that class.
JD:Remember when we both got there early and the door-

Though I was sure I said it loudly, Strawberry Sprinkled Donut made no indication that they’d heard me.
They walked over to another table full of our co-workers, and we didn’t talk for the rest of the night.
