Berry:Maybe we should play some kind of game.
Berry:Like an icebreaker.
[name]:Sure.
[name]:What kind of game were you thinking?
Berry:How about we draw pictures and the other person has to guess what it is?
Berry:I have a notebook and pen in my bag.
[name]:Oh that sounds fun!
Berry:Great!
Berry:Okay, I’ll go.
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut started drawing a couple of lines onto the paper.
Berry:Start guessing!
[name]:Oh okay!
[name]:Well I think it looks kind of like. . .

startBranch1
Berry:Yeah! It’s a dog!
Berry:How did you get that so quickly?
[name]:Well I saw the little face and ears and figured it was some cute animal, so I went with a popular choice.
Berry:Sound strategy.
Berry:I’ll have to try something a little harder for the next one.

startBranch2
Berry:Does it really look like that?
Berry:That’s not what I was going for, but it sounds delicious!

StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut’s expression turned grim.

Berry:Whaat? Are you kidding?
Berry:Don’t be silly!
Berry:If it were you I would’ve put in a little more effort.
Berry:I didn’t draw any powdered sugar at all.
Berry:I think I’d need some colored pencils for that.
Berry:Wait, just give me five minutes, I’ll fix it!
[name]:That’s okay, don’t worry about it!
[name]:If it wasn’t me in the first place, don’t make yourself crazy.

StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut looks deadly serious.

O-okay!
I’m scared! 
endDecision
startBranch1
Berry:Yes! Let’s go!
Berry:Extreme Pictionary, no holds barred!
[name]:What does that mean?
Berry:It means I’m going to destroy you, and then eat a bunch of pretzels.
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:There’s no need to be scared!
Berry:I haven’t even started drawing yet.
[name]:Oh, haha.

StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut started drawing lines, circles and x’s all over the paper.
[name]:Are you playing tic-tac-toe?
Berry:No!
Berry:But you’re kind of close.
[name]:How can I be close?
Berry:Just keep looking!
Berry:Look!
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut drew a picture of a basketball hoop and a ball.
[name]:It’s basketball!
Berry:Nooo, but it’s like that.
[name]:Wait, is the tic-tac-toe supposed to be like a play?
[name]:Like a basketball strategy?
[name]:That’s pretty smart!
Berry:No, it's just tic-tac-toe.
Berry:Don’t read too much into it.
StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut drew a picture of a deck of cards.
Berry:Okay, I’m gonna give you one more guess.
[name]:Okay, is it. . .

Things that are boring? 
Games? 
Gambling?

Berry:You think basketball is boring?
[name]:No, I’m just terrible at it so it’s hard for me to enjoy.
[name]:It’s exciting to watch though.
Berry:Aw, maybe if you learned to play you’d like it more.
Berry:I used to play back in high school.
[name]:Really?
Berry:I wasn’t like on a team or anything.
Berry:We just played on the weekends sometimes.
Berry:Me and a few friends.
Berry:We should play sometime!
Berry:But anyway, I was actually trying to draw different kinds of games.
backToMain
startBranch2
Berry:Yes!
Berry:It was games!
Berry:Wow, you did such a good job.
Berry:I tried to throw you off by drawing stuff from different mediums, but you totally got it.
backToMain
startBranch3
Berry:Gambling? 
[name]:Yeah. 
[name]:Like poker, or betting on a basketball game?
Berry:Do you bet on tic-tac-toe?
[name]:I thought maybe all the weird marks were like keeping track of bets or something.
Berry:You’ve never gambled a day in your life, have you?
Berry:Anyway, I was actually trying to draw different kinds of games.

[name]:That was pretty fun!
Berry:You should try to draw one too.
[name]:Okay, I’ll try.
I took the paper from StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut and started to draw.
???:Hey.
When I looked up from the paper, I saw the stranger’s voice belonged to Jelly Donut.
[name]:Oh, hi!
JD:Sorry to interrupt.
[name]:No, that’s okay!
[name]:Um, StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut this is my classmate Jelly Donut.
Berry:Oh!

JD:Uh, yeah.
Berry:You should sit with us!
Berry:If you want.
Berry:I’d love to meet one of [name]'s friends!
JD:Ah, yeah sure.
JD:Sounds good.
Jelly Donut pulled up a stool and sat down.
Berry:I work with Player Name at the diner.
JD:Oh, I didn’t know you had a part-time job.
Berry:You never mentioned it?

Though I was sure I said it loudly, StrawBerry Sprinkled Donut made no indication that they’d heard me.
They walked over to another table full of our co-workers, and we didn’t talk for the rest of the night.
