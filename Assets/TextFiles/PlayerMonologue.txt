*YAWN*
Another beautiful day.
Wait, what time is it?
Crap! 
I can’t believe today’s already the first day of class at Fried Sweets University!
I gotta get out of here!
Ugh! 
I hate rushing, I don’t even know how to start my morning yet!
I looked into the bathroom mirror and smacked my face with cold water.
What a mess, my powdered sugar is all congealed.
Ok [name], you already started off your first day of school like a dumb-dumb for oversleeping. 
Now stop looking like a living corpse and go run towards the university!
Don’t be late!
I barged out the door in a rush to get to the school, but while on the way there, I began to contemplate.
The first thought I had when I moved to New Dough City was “Wow, there are so many varieties of flavors here, this is way different than the countryside where I grew up up.”
I don’t want to leave a bad impression on anyone yet, I already screwed that up this morning by being late.
Let me check what my first class is...oh, "Introduction to Psychology".
Hopefully I can make some friends this week, or this new city might be the death of my social life.
