[name]:It was nice of the professor to let us use the classroom for our interviews.
JD:Yeah. 
JD:It definitely beats having to meet them at the coffee shop in terms of privacy. 
JD:And it’s cheaper because we don't have to buy another drink every 20 minutes to keep the table.
[name]:True. 
[name]:But I do love those little mini muffins they have.
JD:I thought of that.
J.D. unveiled a tray of homemade cookies.
[name]:Oh my god.
JD:I thought the sugar would help donuts open up.
I looked over J.D.’s impressive spread of cookies and reached out to grab. . .

[name]:This cookie is really complex!
[name]:How did you have time to make this?
JD:It’s nothing.
JD:It's just a hobby.

[name]:This is excellent.
[name]:But if you really wanted donuts to open up you should've brought a bottle of something.
[name]:Haha, next time.

startBranch3
[name]:This is delicious!
[name]:I think this is your best idea yet.
JD:Well if being a researcher doesn’t work out, I plan on becoming the world’s most successful and mysterious candy maker.
[name]:Oh?
JD:But then when I get too old to run my magical factory, 
JD:I’ll send out invitations to 5 lucky children from all over the world for a job interview, 
JD:and then have them fight to the death.
[name]:You had me until the ending there.
JD:You can’t say that’s not exactly what that book was about.

[name]:So who are we meeting with today?
JD:Someone named Old Fashioned Donut.
[name]:! //(surprise sound effect)
JD:It doesn’t say they’re a student, 
JD:but since we only recruited from within the university, I don’t know how that could be right. 
[name]:Old Fashioned Donut graduated early so they could pursue their career as a writer.
JD:Oh, you know them?
[name]:Is that a conflict of interest?
JD:We might have to declare it as one.
JD:But since we’re students interviewing other students, its inevitable we might know some of them,
JD:so I think it’ll be okay.
*KNOCK*KNOCK*KNOCK* //(knocking sound effect)
JD:Oh, I guess they’re here.
[name]:Oh! Okay! 
[name]:This’ll be great!
*KNOCK*KNOCK*KNOCK* //(knocking sound effect)
JD:I’ll let them in.
It will be great.

So why do I feel so uneasy?
OLDIE:Hey.
[name]:Hi!
[name]:What are you doing here?
OLDIE:This is for a research project right?
JD:Yeah, you’re in the right place.
OLDIE:So you’re taking psych?
OLDIE:That suits you.
[name]:Oh!
[name]:Haha, really?
OLDIE:You just seem really mature and self-aware.
decisionBranch
No, I’m not all that. -->
You think so? -->
endDecision	
startBranch1
[name]:I’m just being myself.
OLDIE:Donuts like that are really hard to come by.
OLDIE:It’s special, don’t diminish it.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:I would describe you that way, but me?
[name]:I don’t know.
OLDIE:Well then if anyone would know, it's me.

JD:Cookie?
OLDIE:No thanks.
OLDIE:I don’t eat anything I haven’t cooked myself.
JD:So did you fill out the release form?
OLDIE:Huh?
OLDIE:Oh yeah.
Old Fashioned Donut opened his bag and started to look through it.
He pulled out a color-coded accordion folder and opened the red tab.
He pulled out a paper folder labeled “For Professor Glazed Donut”.
Then he opened the folder and produced the release form.
But. . .
J.D. looks annoyed.
JD:What is this?
OLDIE:It's the form.
JD:It’s laminated?
OLDIE:It’s better for organization.
JD:Actually I think it’ll probably just make it stick out from all the others.
OLDIE:Then it’ll be easier to find.
[name]:Okay, why don’t we get started?
JD:Yeah, fine.
[name]:So how did you hear about the study? 
OLDIE:I took psych with your professor when I went here.
OLDIE:They asked me if I’d be interested in participating in the study and I said yes.
OLDIE:Glazed hired me to assist with a couple of research projects back in the day, so I thought this was my chance to give back.
decisionBranch
That’s so nice of you! -->
We really appreciate it! -->
endDecision
startBranch1
OLDIE:It seemed like the thing to do.
OLDIE:I owe my success to donuts like Glazed who gave me a chance when I was first starting my career.
JD:What exactly is it you do?
OLDIE:I’m a romance writer.
OLDIE:My book “So Goes Love” actually just got nominated for an award.
JD:Congrats.
backToMain
startBranch2
[name]:You have no idea how tough the recruitment process was.
[name]:I guess there aren’t that many donuts willing to put their emotions on public display.
[name]:Even though the study is anonymous.
OLDIE:Most donuts are insecure.
JD:. . .

JD:Let’s get to the next question.
JD:“How do you show someone that you care about them?”
OLDIE:That’s it?
JD:It?
OLDIE:Seems pretty straightforward. 
OLDIE:You tell them.
JD:Tell them what?
OLDIE:That you care about them.
JD:That’s what you would do?
OLDIE:There’s no point in talking around it.
OLDIE:That just seems kind of cowardly.
JD:Cowardly?!
OLDIE:Yeah.
OLDIE:I think if you want something, you have to be willing to lay it on the line.
JD:Maybe some donuts think actions are more important.
OLDIE:Aren’t you asking for my opinion?
JD:. . .
OLDIE:Oh. 
OLDIE:I see what’s going on.
[name]:What are you talking about?
OLDIE:Jelly Donut likes you, but they feel threatened by me because they’re too scared to tell you how they feel.
[name]:! //(surprise sound effect)
JD:! //(surprise sound effect)
JD:Are you insane?
OLDIE:Maybe that was too direct.
OLDIE:But it was just exhausting to watch.
JD:Who even are you?
OLDIE:Old Fashioned Donut.
JD:This is crap.
JD:I’m leaving.
[name]:No, J.D. don’t leave!

It was just a joke! 
Don’t worry, I don’t believe it.

JD:Hilarious. 
JD:Hope you two have a good laugh.
OLDIE:I wasn’t joking.

JD:Something that ridiculous isn’t even worth responding to.

I chased J.D. out into the hallway, but they were already gone.
