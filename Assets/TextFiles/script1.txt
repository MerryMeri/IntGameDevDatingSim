*You wake up yawning, before quickly realizing that you slept through your alarm, quickly jumping out of bed to get ready*
Crap! 
I can’t believe today’s already the first day of class at Fried Sweets University! 
I gotta get out of here!
Ugh! 
I freaking hate rushing, I don’t even know how to start my morning yet!
*You look into the bathroom mirror, smacking your face with cold water and scolding yourself*
Ok Meri, you already started off your first day of school like a dumb-dumb for oversleeping. 
Now stop looking like a living corpse and go run towards the university!
Don’t be late!
*You barge out of your home in a rush to get to the school, but while on the way there, you begin to contemplate*
The first thought I had when I moved to New Dough City was “Wow, there are so many varieties of flavors here, this is way different than the countryside where I grew up in Bei Ocean Gnet.”
I don’t want to leave a bad impression on anyone yet, I already screwed that up this morning by being late.
Let me check what my first class is...oh, it seems as if I start the school day in my Psychology class.
Hopefully I can make some friends this first week of school or this new city might be the death of my social life.
