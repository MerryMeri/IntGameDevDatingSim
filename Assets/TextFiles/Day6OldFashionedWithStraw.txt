OLDIE:I can’t thank you enough for putting this all together.
[name]:Please, it was easy.
[name]:Apparently students can reserve the space for pretty much whatever they want.
[name]:When I told them it was a book reading for an alum, they okayed it right away.
OLDIE:Do you think anyone will show up?

Of course. 
Probably.

[name]:A lot more donuts are interested in this kind of thing than you’d think.
[name]:I told everyone in my classes about it too, so I'm sure at least some donuts will come.

OLDIE:I’m starting to feel a little stressed about this.
[name]:That’s normal.
[name]:Just, take a breath.
OLDIE:I think I’m gonna take a walk.
OLDIE:I don’t want to stand here and wait for donuts to file in.
[name]:Do you want me to come with you?
OLDIE:No, I just have to clear my head.
OLDIE:Can you keep watch here?
[name]:Sure, no problem.
[name]:See you in a bit.
. . .
I hope this goes well.
I took a moment to look around the room.
[name]:!
Hold on.
Is that Strawberry Sprinkled Donut?
[name]:Hey!
BERRY:Hey!
[name]:It’s good to see you!
[name]:What are you doing here?
BERRY:I’m here for the book reading!
BERRY:I’m a huge fan of Old Fashion Donut’s stories.	
BERRY:But I had no idea they were an alumnus!
[name]:Oh that’s great!
BERRY:I’m looking forward to it.
BERRY:But I have to say, 
BERRY:I was surprised to hear that their new book is a sci-fi novel.
BERRY:They’re usually so good with romance, so I guess I was a little let down.
[name]:I think trying something new is good!
[name]:It keeps things fresh.
BERRY:I can understand that.
BERRY:Between you and me, I haven’t been loving their most recent stories.
BERRY:I feel like they really peaked when they released “So Goes Love”, but their writing’s different now.
[name]:Well, what’s wrong with it?
BERRY:It just doesn’t feel as impassioned anymore.
BERRY:It’s a little. . .detached I guess?
BERRY:Makes me kinda sad.
BERRY:But, I’m excited for the new book all the same.
OLDIE:Hi.
[name]:Oh, Old Fashioned Donut!
[name]:You’re back.
Oh no, Old Fashioned Donut looks kind of upset.
Did they hear any of that?
BERRY:You’re Old Fashioned Donut?!
BERRY:I’m a big fan, it’s great to meet you.
OLDIE:Ah, nice to meet you.
OLDIE:Thanks for your support.
[name]:Old Fashioned Donut, this is my friend Strawberry Sprinkled Donut.
BERRY:You two know each other?!
BERRY:Why didn’t you tell me?

I didn’t know you were a fan. 
I was going to.

BERRY:That’s fair.
BERRY:I guess I don’t talk about it too often.
BERRY:It’s kind of a guilty pleasure.

BERRY:I mean-

BERRY:Well I guess if you didn’t know I liked them, you really wouldn’t have had a reason to.

[name]:Um, are you ready?
[name]:We should probably start soon.
OLDIE:Yup.
OLDIE:Feelin great.
BERRY:I’ll get out of your hair.
BERRY:Good luck with the reading!
BERRY:I can’t wait!
[name]:Have fun!
As more donuts started to come in, Old Fashioned Donut’s expression became more hardened.
OLDIE:Excuse me everyone.
OLDIE:Thank you for coming.
OLDIE:My name is Old Fashioned Donut, and today I’ll be reading an excerpt from my book “Electric Oblivion”.
Old Fashioned Donut read from their manuscript passionately.
As they finished, I thought I saw a rattled look in their eyes.
OLDIE:Thank you.
OLDIE:I’ll now take a few questions from the group.
Old Fashioned Donut answered some questions about the story and their prior work.
Then Strawberry Sprinkled Donut raised their hand.
OLDIE:Yes, you there.
OLDIE:What’s your question?
BERRY:Well I’ve been a fan of your work for a while now.
BERRY:And I always look forward to your releases every week.
BERRY:I think some fans feel that your writing has had a notable shift in tone over the past few months.
BERRY:So I guess I was just wondering. . .
BERRY:How do you feel about the current state of your work?
OLDIE:As I’ve answered previously, I feel that I’ve reached my limit with romance writing.
OLDIE:I’m satisfied with my contribution to the genre, and am ready to pursue other avenues.
OLDIE:Do you have any questions related to this book?
BERRY:Is that why you’ve made a sudden shift to sci-fi?
OLDIEI wouldn’t exactly call it sudden.
OLDIE:These are ideas I’ve had in the works for awhile.
OLDIE:It takes a lot more time to write a novel than a short story.
BERRY:Are you just giving up on romance entirely?
OLDIE:I’m sorry if you’re disappointed, but I have to do what’s best for my art and myself.
OLDIE:That’s enough questions for today, thank you everyone.
Old Fashioned Donut hurried off the makeshift stage and made for the door.
[name]:Wait, are you leaving?
OLDIE:I forgot. . .
OLDIE:I have to pick up my dry-cleaning.
[name]:I thought it went really great!
OLDIE:Haha.
OLDIE:Yeah.
OLDIE:It was SUPER fantastic.
OLDIE:. . .
OLDIE:I gotta go.

Old Fashioned Donut left the student center without me.
Before following them, I went to talk to Strawberry Sprinkled Donut.
[name]:Um, I think that was a little harsh.
BERRY:I didn’t mean to get them flustered or anything.
BERRY:I guess I just felt a little hurt.
BERRY:They sounded a lot more cavalier about the whole thing than I would’ve liked.
[name]:Maybe it looked that way, but I know personally that it’s been eating them up.
BERRY:Oh, I didn’t know.
Sorry.
[name]:Don’t worry about it.
[name]:Thanks for coming anyway.
I tried to call Old Fashioned Donut on my way home, but got no response.
