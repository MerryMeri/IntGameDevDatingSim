OLDIE:I can’t thank you enough for putting this all together.
[name]:Please, it was easy.
[name]:Apparently students can reserve the space for pretty much whatever they want.
[name]:When I told them it was a book reading for an alum, they okayed it right away.
OLDIE:Do you think anyone will show up?
decisionBranch
Of course. 
Probably.

[name]:I’m positive.
[name]:Let’s go into this optimistically.
[name]:And whether it ends up being 2 donuts or 20 donuts, just give it your all.

[name]:A lot more donuts are interested in this kind of thing than you’d think.
[name]:I told everyone in my classes about it too, so I'm sure at least some donuts will come.

OLDIE:I’m starting to feel a little stressed about this.
[name]:That’s normal.
[name]:Just, take a breath.
OLDIE:I think I’m gonna take a walk.
OLDIE:I don’t want to stand here and wait for donuts to file in.
[name]:Do you want me to come with you?
OLDIE:No, I just have to clear my head.
OLDIE:Can you keep watch here?
[name]:Sure, no problem.
[name]:See you in a bit.
. . .
I hope this goes well.
I took a moment to look around the room.
[name]:!
Hold on.
Is that Jelly Donut?
[name]:Hey!
JD:Oh hey.
[name]:How’s it going?
JD:Fine.
JD:I didn’t really have any plans today so, 
JD:I thought I’d come check out this book thing.
[name]:That’s great!
[name]:Are you familiar with the author?
[name]:Old Fashioned Donut?
BERRY:Not really.
JD:I just heard it was supposed to be some romance writer’s first try at a sci-fi epic.
JD:It sounded kind of funny.
[name]:Funny?
JD:Donuts in my class were saying they think it’ll be a flop.
[name]:What?
[name]:Why?
JD:Just cause going from one genre to another is kind of unpredictable I guess.
[name]:So what, you came hoping to watch someone fail?
JD:Not me!
JD:But some other donuts probably.
JD:I’d rather go into it with an open mind.
[name]:Yeah right.
JD:I mean it.
JD:Cringe comedy isn't really my thing.
OLDIE:Hi.
[name]:Oh, Old Fashioned Donut!
[name]:You’re back.
Oh god, Old Fashioned Donut looks kind of mad.
Did they hear any of that?
[name]:Uh, this is my friend J.D.
[name]:From class.
JD:So you’re the author?
JD:You didn’t mention you knew each other.

Oh, didn’t I?
Sorry, I was just getting to that.

OLDIE:Really great.
[name]:Cool, cool.
[name]:Okay.
[name]:So. . . we should probably get started soon.
JD:I’ll go take a seat.
JD:Good luck.
OLDIE:. . .
[name]:Thanks for coming!
As more donuts started to come in, Old Fashioned Donut’s expression became more hardened.)
OLDIE:Excuse me everyone.
OLDIE:Thank you for coming.
OLDIE:My name is Old Fashioned Donut, and today I’ll be reading an excerpt from my book “Electric Oblivion”.
Old Fashioned Donut read from their manuscript passionately.
As they finished, I thought I saw a rattled look in their eyes.
OLDIE:Thank you.
OLDIE:I’ll now take a few questions from the group.
Old Fashioned Donut answered some questions about the story and their prior work.
Then Jelly Donut raised their hand.
OLDIE:Yes, you.
OLDIE:What’s your question?
JD:Considering all your work so far has been in romance, what made you decide to start writing sci-fi?
OLDIE:You know,
OLDIE:just because I’ve seen success in a particular genre, that doesn’t necessarily mean that’s where my talents end, 
OLDIE:or even where my passion lies.
JD:Are you saying you’re not interested in writing romance?
OLDIE:I just don’t like the idea of being pigeon holed because of my previous work.
OLDIE:That being said, I’m excited to explore something more new and inventive with my writing.
OLDIE:Thank you.
JD:Sorry, but didn’t you say you were still writing romance stories for a magazine?
JD:How can you write something you’re not interested in?
OLDIE:I think romance is perfectly interesting.
OLDIE:That’s enough questions for today, thank you everyone.
Old Fashioned Donut hurried off the makeshift stage and made for the door.
[name]:Wait, are you leaving?
OLDIE:I forgot. . .
OLDIE:I have to pick up my dry-cleaning.
[name]:I thought it went really great!
OLDIE:Haha.
OLDIE:Yeah.
OLDIE:It was SUPER fantastic.
OLDIE:. . .
OLDIE:I gotta go.

[name]:Try not to take it to heart.
[name]:I'm sure J.D. didn't mean anything by it.
OLDIE:Imagine it was you.
OLDIE:Would you take it to heart?

OLDIE:Whatever. 
OLDIE:Goodbye.

Old Fashioned Donut left the student center without me.
Before following them, I went to talk to Jelly Donut.
[name]:Hey!
[name]:What were you grilling them for?
JD:I wasn’t trying to be rude.
JD:I guess it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way.
JD:Hearing a writer bash on the genre they’re most liked for. . .
JD:I don’t know, it just kind of feels like they're insulting their fans.
[name]:Well, you got your point across.
JD:I’m sorry.
[name]:Forget it.
[name]:Thanks for coming.
I tried to call Old Fashioned Donut on my way home, but got no response.
